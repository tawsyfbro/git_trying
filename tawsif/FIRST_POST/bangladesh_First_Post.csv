high court’s decision
, which puts an end to the capture and captivity of young Asian elephants.Hereâs why it matters.Legal protectionThere are around 200 Asian elephants in Bangladesh.Nearly half of them are in captivity.The forest department previously issued licensing allowing logging companies to capture these elephants.The companies would then use the elephants to haul logs.However, the elephants would also be made to perform in the circus and in street shows.The court intervened as this violated the the terms of the licences.“The high court today suspended all licences for the captive rearing of elephants,” Amit Das Gupta, deputy attorney general of the country, told AFP.Bangladesh was once a major home for Asian elephants.But poaching and habitat loss saw their numbers dwindle.So much that they have now beenÂ  declared critically endangered.The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) says there are nearly 100 captive Asian elephants in Bangladesh, nearly half the amount of elephants left in the wild in the country.As logging and farming encroach on elephant territory, young animals are captured in the country’s northern and southeastern hills.The forestry department has previously issued licences to logging groups who use the elephants to drag tree trunks, or to circus groups â to adopt the animals.But Gupta said the elephants were being exploited and used for begging and “street extortion”, breaking the licence terms.Will end the brutal trainingRights groups claim that the high court’s decision to suspend licences would end often brutal training â known as “hadani”.“This is a landmark order,” said Rakibul Haque Emil, head of the animal rights group People for Animal Welfare (PAW) Foundation in Bangladeshi.PAW and actor Jaya Ahsan launched a public interest litigation against captive elephant licencing.“In this name of training elephants, private licensees including circus parties brutally separate elephant calves from their mother, shackle them for months and then torture them to teach tricks,” Emil said.“We hope it is the end of hadani in Bangladesh,” he added.The plight of the captive elephants was highlighted May when a young elephant, used for begging on the streets, was killed by a train.Some daub the elephants in colourful paint and force them to do tricks on the streets, asking for cash for their performance.In May 2019 police also rescued two emaciated elephants from their owners after the animals were used for roadside begging. The elephants were later handed over to Dhaka Zoo.Emil said they would mobilise support for the rehabilitation of captive elephants.“Several countries in Asia such as Thailand and Nepal have found some success in rehabilitating captive elephants,” he said. “We shall do it here.”With inputs from AFP",The Bangladesh High Court on Sunday granted legal protection to Bangladesh’s endangered wild elephants.

The petition was moved by the man’s uncle.In the plea, it was alleged that Chakma is Indian citizenship by birth and had his initial education in Gomati in Tripura and later in Shillong, Meghalaya.For the unversed, a habeas corpus petition is filed seeking direction to produce a person who is missing or has been illegally detained.Chakma was apprehended at the Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport in October 2022 during immigration clearance when he was attempting to depart for Dhaka (Bangladesh’s capital) using a fraudulently obtained Indian passport.It was being alleged that Chakma entered India illegally through porous border and managed to obtain Indian documents in fraudulent and dishonest manner.However, theÂ authorities claimed after scrutiny it transpired that Chakma had been visiting India till 2016 on the basis of multiple Indian visas on a passport issued to him by Bangladesh.They also claimed he had left India on a Bangladeshi passport in June 2016 and it was not known how he subsequently sneaked into India.Chakma’s passport was revoked by the Indian authorities in June 2023.The Delhi court said, as per Chakma’s own admission before the Bangladeshi authorities, when he had applied for visa for India in 2010-2011, he claimed to be a Bangladeshi national by birth.The judicial body further said no plausible response was given regarding the said documents and the passport issued to Chakma by the Bangladeshi authorities and that how and when he entered India after he had gone to Dhaka on the basis of Bangladeshi passport.It further said Chakma himself is to be blamed for his miseries as he has failed to explain as to how he came to India when he had left the country on a Bangladeshi passport.âIt is not a case of preventive detention.

I also congratulate the people of Bangladesh for the successful conduct of elections. We are committed to further strengthen our enduring and people-centric partnership with Bangladesh,” PM Modi said in a statement on social media platform X.The general elections in Bangladesh were marred by sporadic violence and a boycott by the main opposition outfit Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its allies.Sheikh Hasina’s party - the Awami League - won 223 seats in the 300-seat Parliament. There were 299 seats up for grabs in the election. According to reports, the death of a candidate has resulted in a postponed election for one seat.The Jatiya Party, which is the biggest opposition in Parliament, gained 11 seats; the Bangladesh Kallyan party won one seat; and 62 seats went to independent candidates. Each party got one seat: the Workers Party of Bangladesh and Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal.In a landslide victory, Hasina, 76, who is also the president of the Awami League, won the Gopalganj-3 constituency, marking her ninth term in parliament.With the second-lowest turnout since democracy was restored in 1991, Hasina, who has ruled the strategically positioned South Asian nation since 2009, won a record-breaking fourth straight term and fifth term overall in the lopsided election.In the contentious elections held in February 1996, the lowest voter turnout in Bangladeshi history was 26.5%.The Election Commission anticipated that the final tally might stand at about 40% when voting closed at 4:00 pm on Sunday. This is a 13% increase in turnout in just one hour. As of 3:00 pm, the turnout in the election was 27.15%.Hasina will likely become Bangladesh’s longest-serving prime leader since the country’s independence with this victory.(With agency inputs)",The general elections in Bangladesh were marred by sporadic violence and a boycott by the main opposition outfit Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its allies,None,None,None,Ajeyo Basu,bangladesh,2024-01-08 19:30:00,2024-01-08 20:00:00,2024-01-08 20:00:00

Due to a candidate’s passing, the Commission decided to suspend voting in one seat.At the very end of the voting period, the Commission revoked the candidacy of the Awami League candidate in power in northeastern Chattogram because he had “scolded and threatened” a police officer. Due to this circumstance, two dissident candidates who are also members of the ruling party will now face off in the constituency’s polls.The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by the sick and imprisoned former premier Khaleda Zia, asked citizens to boycott the polls, which resulted in a poor voter turnout. No election would be held under the current administration, according to the party would be fair and credible.Nothing of the customary election-day fervor was evident. There were only election agents and supporters of the ruling party there, even in front of the campaign booths.Absent lengthy lines, voters cast their ballots without interruption, giving the presiding officers free time.Three locationsâtwo in Narayanganj and one in Narsingdiâwere closed to voting. According to sources, the Election Commission issued an order for the son of Industries Minister Nurul Majid Mahmud Humayun to be arrested on suspicion of election fraud in Narsingdi.During a fight between the supporters of two candidates vying for the Chattogram-10 seat, shots were fired. Shot, two individuals were transported to Chattogram Medical College Hospital: Shanto Barua, 24, and Jamal, 35.Following a brawl between Awami League supporters and an independent candidate at a voting place in Jamalpur’s Sharishabari, two persons were hurt.Two homemade explosives detonated close to a polling place in Hazaribagh, Dhaka, injuring four peopleâamong them a kid.The nation’s Election Commission reports that 119.6 million registered voters were able to cast ballots at more than 42,000 polling places on Sunday.Along with 436 independents, almost 1,500 candidates representing 27 political parties were running for office.The 12th general election is being held under strict security, and over 100 foreign observers, including three from India, are watching it.During the elections, around 7.5 lakh law enforcement and security personnel would be on duty to maintain peace and order.Shortly after the polls opened, Prime Minister Hasina cast her ballot at the Dhaka City College polling place. She was accompanied by her daughter Saima Wazed.Since 2009, Hasina, 76, has ruled; her Awami League became victorious in the most recent election in December 2018.She is expected to win a fifth term overall and a fourth term as prime minister.(With agency inputs)",The electoral commission reported an hour before the polls closed that 27.15% of voters had participated at 3 p.m. Overall voter turnout for the 2018 general election was over 80%,None,None,None,Ajeyo Basu,bangladesh,2024-01-07 21:42:00,2024-01-07 22:12:00,2024-01-07 22:12:00

The publication of fabricated and baseless information by the media cell of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in international media and institutions without any verification is contrary to objective journalism,” the statement read.“They say since October 28, 2023, more than 21,000 BNP-Jamaat leaders and workers have been arrested and nine have died in custody. They have no basis for such information. The total number of prisons in Bangladesh is 68. According to the information provided by the prison department, the number of prisoners in all the prisons today is 80 thousand 097. On December 31, 2021, the number of prisoners was 80 thousand 871 people, on the same day of 2022 there were 80 thousand 537 people and on the last day of 2023 there were 83 thousand 689 people. Compared to previous years, the number of prisoners on the last day of 2023 was almost the same,” the statement added.“From this information it is understood that the number of additional prisoners of 21 thousand leaders and workers of BNP is not correct. Additional inmate information is incorrect. This is propaganda.”The Bangladesh government alleged that there was no law and order problem in the country before a pre-election campaign by the BNP led to a spike in political violence.During the period July-September 2023, an average of 565 cases were registered and 1 thousand 956 people were arrested in police stations in Bangladesh. Even if there is no political tension or conflict, the average number of cases filed and arrests in each police station in Bangladesh remains at this level. But since the BNP’s subversive political program was strengthened on October 28, 2023, an average of 438 cases have been entered and 1,816 arrests have been made every day since November 22,"" the statement said.“After the unprecedented BNP-Jamaat terror attack on October 28, the number of arrests increased, but the number of cases of other crimes decreased. According to the sources of the Directorate of Prisons, from 26/10/23 to 05/01/24, the police arrested a total of 20,46 people on the charges of explosives, sabotage, murder, attack on journalists, car vandalism and following the same judicial process, 10,000 997 people were released on bail. Today on 06/01/24, a total of 9 thousand 49 prisoners are in jail in this related case,” it added.On October 28, during an opposition party protest calling for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s resignation and a free and fair election under a caretaker government, one police officer was slain in Bangladesh on Saturday and over 100 people were injured. The government rejected the demand, citing it as unconstitutional.Tens of thousands of supporters of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) gathered in the capital Dhaka, chanting anti-government chants, sparking skirmishes that resulted in the use of tear gas and rubber bullets by police.The statement went on to claim that there was no violence or repression of opposition workers and leaders inside jails in Bangladesh.“In October 2023, a total of 44 inmates died of natural causes due to physical ailments in prisons across Bangladesh, which was the same number in November. 42 people died in December. Apart from the brutal killing of the four national leaders, that is, the top leaders of the Bangladesh Awami League, on November 3, 1975, there has been no unusual death inside the jail,” it said.“No prisoner was ever tortured inside the jail as the prisoners had no political identity with the prison authorities. The names and addresses of the 9 BNP leaders-workers given by the New York Times and ANFREL were not given.

The party says Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League is trying to legitimise a sham vote to gain a fourth straight term.Hasina, who has refused BNP demands to resign and cede power to a neutral authority to run the election, accuses the opposition of instigating anti-government protests that have rocked Dhaka since late October and killed at least 10 people.A senior BNP official, Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, said Friday’s express train fire was âundoubtedly an act of sabotage and crueltyâ, while blaming the ruling party for it.Four people died last month in a train blaze set by protesters during a countrywide strike called by the opposition.On Saturday, Dhaka’s usually busy roads were largely deserted, although security forces patrolled in armoured vehicles. About 800,000 security officials will guard polling booths on Sunday, while some of the armed forces have fanned out nationwide to help keep the peace.Police said unidentified arsonists also set fire to at least five primary schools, including four polling booths.They are investigating fires in Gazipur, on the outskirts of Dhaka, suspected to have been set in the middle of the night by those aiming to disrupt Sunday’s election.âWe have intensified patrolling and remain on high alert,â said Gazipur police chief Kazi Shafiqul Alam.Arsonists also attacked polling booths in the northeastern districts of Moulavibazar and Habiganj, police said, with similar incidents reported elsewhere in the past two days.Police in the coastal district of Khulna arrested two people on Thursday night accused of trying to set fire to a school. The following day, another bid to set fire to a primary school nearby was averted, said Saidur Rahman, police chief of the district.","On Saturday, Dhaka’s usually busy roads were largely deserted, although security forces patrolled in armoured vehicles.

Considered to be the best cricketer to come out out of Bangladesh as well as current captain of the ODI team, Shakib is set to contest in the country’s 12th parliamentary elections.He is fighting from Magura-1 constituency, his home district, for the ruling Awami League and polls take place on 7 January.On the field, Shakib can play whatever role you need him to take over. He is a brilliant fielder who can score truckloads of runs and can bowl multiple overs of his trick spin bowling relentlessly. On the political pitch also, the seasoned cricketer has emerged as a top-notch performer, campaigning actively for his seat and the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.The interesting thing, however, is that Shakib’s victory is almost granted. Not because he is hugely popular in his home district.âI donât think he would have won it if there was a proper election. Shakib is no longer popular here,â a Magura resident had said about Shakib to Al Jazeera.Still, Shakib is certain to win because the main opposition force, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party has boycotted the elections.Hasina has been the PM since 2009 but her victories in 2014 and 2018 were marred by irregularities. She is someone who is also seen as an authoritarian.The BNP wanted Hasina to cede power to a caretaker government to hold the elections but after its demand was not met, the party, led by Tarique Rahman who is in exile in London, boycotted the polls.This is not to say Shakib could not have won if BNP was contesting. After all, he is arguably the most popular man in the country.But will getting elected to the parliament bring an end to his cricketer career like it did for his former teammate Masharafe Mortaza?No.Shakib isn’t ready to hang his boots.“I think they (cricket and politics) can be managed. Managing time will not be a problem because I have done it in the past and can do it in future as well, and have full confidence on me to make that happen,” he said in an interview with Cricbuzz.“I don’t think that will be the case with me (having any misunderstanding with the board) because I am straightforward.”Politics is a new turf for the star all-rounder but he is not ready to leave the old one, even if it means playing two innings at once.","On the political pitch also Shakib Al Hasan has emerged as a top-notch performer, campaigning actively for his seat and the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.",None,None,None,FirstCricket Staff,bangladesh,2024-01-06 17:36:00,2024-01-06 18:06:00,2024-01-06 18:06:00

As per the law, an election in one constituency was postponed after an independent candidate died of natural causes. This time, 5.1 per cent of the total candidates are women â the highest such share ever, Reuters reported.About 120 million registered voters will decide the fate of 1,896 candidates in the fray, as per CNBC-TV18. Approximately half of voters are women, and 15 million of them are first-time voters.This year, ballot stations are opening amid an increasingly polarised political culture led by two powerful women; current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Opposition leader and former premier Khaleda Zia.Posing a new challenge to the ruling Awami League party, the main opposition party has called for national strikes this weekend and is pushing voters to join its boycott.Letâs take a closer look at why the Opposition has called for the election boycott.Opposition calls for election boycottAccording to AP, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), headed by Zia, and other opposition parties are boycotting the upcoming election, saying there is no guarantee it will be free, fair and inclusive under Hasinaâs administration.For those unversed, the BNP had boycotted the 2014 election but took part in the 2018 polls, as per Hindustan Times.According to PTI, with the latest strike, the BNP aims to garner support for its non-cooperation movement against the Awami Party-led dispensation through the strike. It has urged people not to pay taxes and utility bills to press its demand for a non-party interim government for election oversight by amending the countryâs Constitution.Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, a senior joint secretary general in Ziaâs party, urged people not to vote on Sunday while calling for strikes. âThe 48-hour hartal (general strike) will begin at 6 am on Saturday and end at 6 am on Monday,â he said on Thursday night in a virtual press briefing as last-minute preparations were underway for the 12th general elections.The strike calls for the âresignation of the illegal government, establishment of a non-party neutral government and release of all party leaders and activists from prison (Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir and Standing Committee Member Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury, who were arrested over charges of violence),â he added.On Friday morning, Rizvi led more than 100 Opposition leaders and activists, holding sticks, marched in the Capitalâs Karwan Bazar area while chanting anti-government slogans. âPeople will not accept this illegal election. People will not accept this election of looters,â he said during the march.On the same day, a group of about 100 left-leaning political activists strode near Dhakaâs National Press Club, demanding the government halt a âfarcical election,â the report said.Ziaâs elder son and BNPâs acting chairperson Tarique Rahman, who has been in self-exile since 2007 in the UK, called the polls a âshamâ that was meant to solidify Sheikh Hasinaâs leadership. In 2023, his party staged a months-long protest to call for Sheikh Hasina’s resignation. During the protest campaign, at least 11 people were killed and thousands of his supporters were arrested.Speaking with AFP, Rahman said that it would be inappropriate for his party to contest in polls with a âpredeterminedâ outcome.Western nations, such as the US, which sanctioned Bangladeshi security forces in 2021 over claims of violating human rights, have called for democratic elections, but rights organisations have warned that the 170 million-peopleÂ nation is on the verge of virtual one-party rule in response to the Opposition’s call for a boycott, as per The Guardian.The opposition has consistently called for Hasina’s removal and the appointment of an impartial caretaker government to supervise the poll. According to AP, the current government, however,Â claimed that was against the country’s constitution.Hasina’s critics claim that she is systematically suppressing the opposition by enforcing harsh security measures. More than 20,000 Opposition supporters, according to Zia’s party, have been taken into custody. The government claimed that numbers were exaggerated and refuted claims that arrests were made for crimes like arson and vandalism rather than because of political opinions.Sheikh Hasina seeks forgivenessHasina, who has been in power for 15 straight years â the longest-serving leader in the countryâs history – addressed the nation in a last televised campaign speech, urging people to head to the ballot stations.âIf I have made any mistakes along the way, I ask your forgiveness. If I can form the government again, I will get a chance to correct the mistakes. Give me an opportunity to serve you by voting for boat (the election symbol of her party) in the 7 January election,â she said.With 302 seats, the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League securedÂ a fourth term in the country’s general elections inÂ 2018. The Jatiya Party, with just 26 seats, was elected as the opposition party. Voter turnout was 80Â per cent back then.According to CNBC-TV18, Hasina, in power since 2009, is credited with restoring Bangladesh’s $416 billion economy and itsÂ garment industry during her tenure. Many also lauded her for providing refuge to about a million Muslims who were Rohingya.However, Bangladesh’s economy was rocked by violent protests in recent times after a jump in the cost of living as the country struggled to pay for costly energy imports amid weakening domestic currency and depleting dollar reserves, Reuters reported.Earlier on Thursday, Hasina, addressing a huge campaign rally at Fatullah near Dhaka, urged all to maintain peace across the country. Violence marred the campaigns that started on 18 December, leaving at least three people dead and others injured.Since the Russia-Ukraine war increased the cost of fuel and food imports, the economy has also slowed significantly, leading Bangladesh to request a $4.7 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund last year, explained The Guardian.Heightened security arrangements for the controversial electionThe International Crisis Group, an independent think tank, stated that even though voter turnout was expected to be low, there was a high chance of political violence.âThe election will not resolve Bangladeshâs political crisis. Since the 2008 election that brought the Awami League to power, the country has not held a credible national election,â The Guardian quoted Pierre Prakash, its Asia director, as saying.Chief election commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal in a closed-door meeting briefed foreign envoys and chiefs of development agencies, including the United Nations, based in Dhaka about electoral preparations. Local media reported that some diplomats asked about how potential violence will be dealt with.Nearly 1.6 million people â half of them security personnel â will oversee the election where 119.1 million registered voters are eligible to vote in more than 42,000 polling stations, the commission said.Nearly 750,000 police, paramilitary, and police auxiliary personnel will be keeping a close eye on the polls. For the polls, the nation has also invited officials from the army, navy, and air force, as per CNBC-TV18.Additionally, as is customary in Bangladesh during general elections, troops have been stationed throughout the nation to provide assistance as required, all while being supervised by magistrates.The Election Commission said about 300 foreign observers, more than 70 of them are foreign journalists have been authorised to monitor and cover the election, according to AP.How fair are elections in BangladeshThe Sheikh Hasina-led party has alsoÂ been accused of fielding “dummies” and askingÂ voters to show up on election day.According to Al Jazeera, aÂ “group of officials in plain clothes” allegedly threatened Hasanul Islam Ador, an elected representativeÂ in the southern Cox’s Bazar district, telling him to “stop campaigningâ against Zafar Alam, an independent candidate running in the national election.Alam now serves as an Awami League representative in parliament for Cox’s Bazar. The party leadership asked him to run as an independent after he was unable to win his party’s nomination for the current election. According to a recent Al Jazeera report, he is one of hundreds of alleged “dummy” candidates that the party is reportedlyÂ supporting in order to give the impression that the election is free and fair.Zia, the BNP chairperson, has been debarred from politics and is effectively under house arrest to serve a 17-year prison term handed down by a court on two graft charges.The 79-year-old ex-prime minister is now in a hospital with multiple health issues.As a result of the election boycott, Hasina appears to be heading towards her fourth consecutive term in office.With inputs from agencies","Bangladesh is set to hold general elections on Sunday.
