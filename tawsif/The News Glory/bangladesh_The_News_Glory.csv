https://thenewsglory.com/bangladesh-court-sentences-nobel-laureate-muhammad-yunus-to-six-months-in-prison/,Bangladesh court sentences Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to six months in prison,"A Bangladesh court on Monday sentenced Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus – and three other people – to six months in prison for multiple violations of labor law.  Sentence that has been made known amid international criticism against the Bangladeshi Government for the judicial persecution against the winner.It was the Dhaka labor court that issued a verdict that, however, does not imply their immediate entry into prison, since those convicted were granted one month’s bail pending their appeal to a higher court.    
 Read also Ima Sanchis “We are being punished for the crime we did not commit,” Yunus told the media in his first reaction upon leaving the judicial complex.His lawyer, Abdullah Al Mamun, has been equally “furious” with the verdict, guaranteeing that there will be an appeal.  “The State could not prove anything.  We present 109 contradictions.  If there is a contradiction, even a person accused of murder is released,” he noted.The UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, Irene Khan, who was present at the trial, calls the verdict a “travesty of justice.”  “As a citizen of Bangladesh, on the first day of 2024, I am shocked and terrified to see what is happening to the rule of law in this country.”“The Labor Court has been used as a weapon against a Nobel Peace Prize winner while labor laws are violated in the most severe way every day, in every factory and even in the streets of violence, and the Government does nothing” Khan added. He created microcredits and founded the Grameen Bank to spread them on a large scale.  He thus lifted millions of families around the world out of poverty, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize. The needs of the poor led him to devise social enterprises, a concept that has gone viral.  He is one of the brains of our time, a great visionary.His proposal, explained in A world of three zeros (Paidós), could sound utopian if it were not born from his own experience that has led him to create a new economic engine, abandoning the assumption that we are motivated by selfishness and betting on altruism.Yunus was accused in September 2021 of failing to establish the Workers’ Contribution Fund and the Welfare Fund in his company, and not sharing the benefits to which they were entitled with his employees.  Other charges include problems proving the regular hiring of 100 workers.Yunus, known as the poor man’s bankerwas recognized in 2006 with the Nobel Peace Prize for having founded the Grameen Bank to combat poverty in Bangladesh through the development of the concept of microcredit, by which loans are granted to people with limited resources who would normally be rejected in the financial system. .However, it has had a tense relationship with the Bangladeshi authorities since Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina came to power.  In 2010, a documentary appeared that denounced alleged illegal fund transfers between the two entities of the Grameen Group.In recent years, Hasina has also criticized Yunus for allegedly influencing the World Bank to cancel financing for the construction of a megaproject, an accusation he denied. Yunus has faced more than 170 cases alleging corruption, money laundering, tax evasion and labor law violations.In an open letter sent to Hasina on August 28, 176 world leaders, including former US President Barack Obama, former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and more than 100 Nobel laureates, expressed concern about the “ continuous judicial processes and harassment” against Yunus.The verdict against the Nobel Peace Prize winner occurs just days before the general elections in Bangladesh, which will take place on January 7, and have been boycotted by the opposition.",None,None,None,None,The News Glory,bangladesh,2024-01-01 16:55:00,2024-01-01 17:25:00

A two-judge bench had referred the matter to the Constitutional Bench in 2014.The bench headed by CJI DY Chandrachud also includes Justice Surya Kant, Justice MM Sundaresh, Justice JB Pardiwala and Justice Manoj Mishra.  The bench has sought data of beneficiaries of this Act.The court said that there is no evidence to suggest that granting Indian citizenship to Bangladeshi immigrants between 1966 and 1971 had an impact on the population and cultural identity of Assam.Acknowledging cross-border infiltration into Assam, the CJI said immigrants also came due to the India-Pakistan war in 1971 for the liberation of Bangladesh.After this, the court asked the Central Government to submit the data of people who received benefits under the law from 1966 to July 16, 2013.The petitioners have sought to declare the provision invalid and direct to formulate a policy for the rehabilitation of people of Indian origin who came to Assam after 1951.What does Section 6A of the Citizenship Act say?Section 6A was added to the Citizenship Act as a special provision to deal with the citizenship of people coming to India under the Assam Accord.  In which it is said that those who came to Assam in 1985 from areas including Bangladesh on or after January 1, 1966 but before March 25, 1971 and have been living there since then, will have to register themselves under Section 18 to obtain Indian citizenship. will be.As a result, this provision set the last date for granting citizenship to Bangladeshi immigrants in Assam as 25 March 1971.Court said- We also had an important role in the formation of BangladeshCJI’s bench said- Keep one thing in mind, if the Parliament grants amnesty to only one group of illegal immigrants, then it is very different.  But it cannot be denied that Section 6A was implemented then which is linked to our history.  India had a very important role in the formation of Bangladesh, because like Bangladesh, we were also a part of the war and then people came to India illegally.Petitioner’s lawyer saidAdvocate Divan, appearing for several petitioners from Assam opposing the amended provision of the Citizenship Act 1955, said the amendment violated the basic structure of the Constitution which is based on secularism and brotherhood of the nation.  He said that there are more illegal immigrants in West Bengal than in Assam.  This provision was applied to Assam as if it were a license for outsiders to come and acquire Indian citizenship.Diwan also placed before the court excerpts of the report prepared by former Assam Governor SK Sinha on the threats posed by people coming to Assam from Bangladesh.  In which it was written that due to the arrival of illegal immigrants the district is turning into a Muslim dominated area.

Domingo’s resignation after giving Bangladesh a taste of victory,"Bangladesh, who defeated Team India in the ODI series, fought hard in the Test series as well.  Bangladesh, who lost the first test by 188 runs, gave a contest in the second innings.  Bangladesh put the tourist team under pressure in the Dhaka Test.  With the help of Shreyas Iyer and Ravichandran Ashwin, Team India narrowly avoided defeat and reached the target of 145 runs with a difference of 3 wickets.After the defeat by India, Jalal Yunus said that they want a coach who will have an impact on the team.  He said that they will see some changes soon.. They want a strong team.  “We have done almost enough to beat India.  We defeated England and Australia on this same ground.  But India is a strong team.  Now we need not only a good coach, but also a mentor,” Jalal opined.As for Russell Domingo, he took over as South Africa’s assistant coach in 2011.  In December 2021, he took over as the coach of the South Africa T20 team.  In August 2013, he took charge as a coach in Tests and ODIs as well.  It was under Doming’s coaching that Bangladesh won the T20 series against India for the first time in 2019.  Bangladesh defeated Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka.  In January 2022, Bangladesh recorded their first win against the Kiwis in Tests after defeating New Zealand.  They won the ODI series in South Africa by 2-1 in the month of March. This is how the Bangladesh management thought of Domingo, who has made his mark on the Bangladesh team and has become the key to the team’s success.  With the World Cup being held in 2023 in Bangladesh’s favorite ODI format, former coach Chandika Hatura Singhe is likely to be selected as the head coach.Read More Sports News And Telugu news",None,None,None,None,The News Glory,bangladesh,2022-12-28 17:51:00,2022-12-28 18:21:00

Nothing happens.  That’s what happened.  But Zakir Hasan’s century on Test debut cannot be blamed for that. Zakir Hasan became Bangladesh’s 4th debutant to score a century on Test debut, overcoming all the pressures given by the Indian bowlers.Umesh Yadav gave the first wicket break.  Umesh Yadav edges Najmul Hussain Shando.  And this catch went to Kohli who left the line, his slip was caught by an alert Rishabh Pant and India got their first wicket after much difficulty.  Zakir Hasan played some great shots and used good technique for the spinners.  He was 82 not out from 195 balls at the tea break.  He then brought up his mammoth century off 224 balls with 13 fours and 1 six before getting a looping ball from Ashwin to the diving catch of Pattu Kohli on the inside edge of the bat.One down batsman Yasir Ali scored 5 runs and was bowled by a superb return ball from Axar Patel.
