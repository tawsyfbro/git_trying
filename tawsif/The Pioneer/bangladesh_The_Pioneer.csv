The accident occurred while they were participating in the Comilla Victorians’ nets at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium. Rahman was hit when he was walking back to his bowling mark, and he was immediately given first-aid on the bleeding spot before being taken to the Imperial Hospital here in an ambulance. However, the subsequent CT scans cleared 28-year-old Rahman of any internal injuries. “During practice, a ball hit directly at the left parietal area (head) of Mustafizur Rahman. There was an open wound at his parietal area and we have worked with compression bandage to stop bleeding and immediately shifted him to Imperial hospital,” a BCB media release stated. The Victorians are scheduled to play Sylhet Strikers in the BPL on Monday, and they are currently placed second on the table with 14 points from nine games behind Rangpur Riders (16 points).Experienced left-arm pacer Mustafizur Rahman was on Sunday admitted to a local hospital after suffering a hit on his head by Litton Das during a training session ahead of a Bangladesh Premier League match.The accident occurred while they were participating in the Comilla Victorians’ nets at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium.Rahman was hit when he was walking back to his bowling mark, and he was immediately given first-aid on the bleeding spot before being taken to the Imperial Hospital here in an ambulance.However, the subsequent CT scans cleared 28-year-old Rahman of any internal injuries.“During practice, a ball hit directly at the left parietal area (head) of Mustafizur Rahman.

https://www.dailypioneer.com//2024/world/myanmar-forces--fighting-ethnic-group-flee--into-bangladesh.html,Myanmar forces  fighting ethnic group flee  into Bangladesh,"n Nearly a hundred members of Myanmar’s Border Guard Police have fled their posts and taken shelter in Bangladesh during fighting between Myanmar security forces and an ethnic minority army, an official of Bangladesh’s border agency said Monday. Shariful Islam, spokesperson for Border Guard Bangladesh, said by phone that the Myanmar forces entered Bangladesh over last two days to escape fighting with the Arakan Army in Myanmar’s Rakhine state bordering Bangladesh. They entered Bangladesh through the Tombru border in Bandarban district, he said. “In total 95, Myanmar troops are there now,” he said. “They have been disarmed and taken to safe places.” Since Saturday, gunshots could be heard coming from the Myanmar side of the border, local media reported. The Arakan Army is the well-trained military wing of the Rakhine ethnic minority seeking autonomy from the central government and has been attacking army outposts in the western state since mid-November. It is part of an alliance of ethnic minority armies that launched an offensive in late October, gaining strategic territory in the country’s northeast bordering China. Its success was widely seen as a major defeat for the military government, which seized power in February 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi and is now embroiled in a wide-ranging civil war. The alliance, called the Three Brotherhood Alliance, said in a statement Monday that the Arakan Army had attacked two border outposts in Maungdaw township in Rakhine state and captured one of them on Sunday. Khaing Thukha, an Arakan Army spokesperson, said later Monday that fighting was still continuing at the second outpost. Myanmar’s military government made no immediate comment.               The alliance includes the Arakan Army, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army. Bangladesh shares a 271-km (168-mile) border with Myanmar and hosts more than 1 million Muslim Rohingya refugees, many of whom fled from Buddhist-dominated Myanmar starting in late August 2017 when its military launched a brutal “clearance operation” against them following attacks by an insurgent group.n Nearly a hundred members of Myanmar’s Border Guard Police have fled their posts and taken shelter in Bangladesh during fighting between Myanmar security forces and an ethnic minority army, an official of Bangladesh’s border agency said Monday.Shariful Islam, spokesperson for Border Guard Bangladesh, said by phone that the Myanmar forces entered Bangladesh over last two days to escape fighting with the Arakan Army in Myanmar’s Rakhine state bordering Bangladesh.They entered Bangladesh through the Tombru border in Bandarban district, he said.“In total 95, Myanmar troops are there now,” he said. “They have been disarmed and taken to safe places.”Since Saturday, gunshots could be heard coming from the Myanmar side of the border, local media reported.The Arakan Army is the well-trained military wing of the Rakhine ethnic minority seeking autonomy from the central government and has been attacking army outposts in the western state since mid-November.It is part of an alliance of ethnic minority armies that launched an offensive in late October, gaining strategic territory in the country’s northeast bordering China.

https://www.dailypioneer.com//2024/sports/india-face-nepal-after-loss-to-bangladesh.html,India face Nepal after loss to Bangladesh,"Smarting from a disappointing 0-1 defeat to Bangladesh, India eye full points in their next game against Nepal in the U-19 Women’s SAFF Championship, to be played here on Tuesday. India conceded an injury-time goal to leave the field empty handed against the hosts on Sunday. Despite the Young Tigresses delivering a strong performance against the home team, the match appeared destined for a draw. However, in the closing moments, Bangladesh emerged successful once again over India. “We entered the match with confidence, expecting a victory, but a minor error cost us the game. Despite a number of attempts on goal, our own mistakes stopped us from capitalising on those opportunities. While our defence was solid, our focus remained on attacking,” said Neha. “Our strategy was to leverage our strengths, but unfortunately, we fell short. Bangladesh proved to be faster, and we knew they had a lot of speed, and regardless of my effort in the first half, my shot from the left turned into a low strike, missing the goal. Although we executed good crosses, they went unconverted,” she added. The challenge for the Indian players would be to quickly put behind this loss and focus on the next game here at the BSSSMK Stadium. In the previous SAFF U-19 Women’s Championship 2019, India secured a victory over Nepal with a solitary goal before advancing to face Bangladesh in the final. A similar scenario will unfold if India secure either a draw or a win against Nepal. Meanwhile, Haryana’s Neha found her way into football under the influence of Renu, who also comes from her locality and is a striker in the senior national women’s team. Drawing inspiration from forward Manisha Kalyan, Neha said, “I aspire to challenge Manisha Di someday, who is my idol.”Smarting from a disappointing 0-1 defeat to Bangladesh, India eye full points in their next game against Nepal in the U-19 Women’s SAFF Championship, to be played here on Tuesday.India conceded an injury-time goal to leave the field empty handed against the hosts on Sunday.Despite the Young Tigresses delivering a strong performance against the home team, the match appeared destined for a draw.However, in the closing moments, Bangladesh emerged successful once again over India.“We entered the match with confidence, expecting a victory, but a minor error cost us the game.

The march started from Sadar Block turn and reached the Collectorate through various intersections. Where it turned into a protest. Addressing the occasion, former Jharkhand Government Minister Sadhnu Bhagat said that in the name of execution of works, they are occupying the land and misleading the sisters and daughters. Situations are being created against tribal traditions.  It may take an explosive form in the coming days. Manir Oraon said that by playing with the constitutional rights of the tribals, they are changing the socio-political environment, which is a threat to the future generations. Omprakash Singh said that despite all the information and data about wrong activities, concrete action is not being taken. The main reason for this is the appeasement politics that the people of Congress and JMM are doing.  Ramesh Oraon said that Lohardaga has been a base for foreign infiltrators for a long time. It is being patronized by special people to fulfill their selfish interests and increase the population. After the protest, a memorandum was given to His Excellency the Governor and the Union Home Minister through the Deputy Commissioner.

https://www.dailypioneer.com//2024/sports/india-outclass-bangladesh-by-84-runs.html,India outclass Bangladesh by 84 runs,"Left-arm spinners Saumy Kumar Pandey and Musheer Khan headlined a dominant Indian performance as the defending champions outclassed Bangladesh by 84 runs in their opening game of the ICC U-19 World Cup here Saturday. While the total of 251 for 7 didn’t look big, the two Indian spinners choked the run-flow, shooting out ‘Tiger Cubs’ for a meagre 167 in 45.5 overs. Skipper Uday Saharan (64 off 94 balls) and left-handed opener Adarsh Singh (76 off 96 balls) hit half-centuries after Bangladesh invited the holders to take first strike. Saumy (4/24) was economical and bowled the lethal arm ball with a skiddy action while all-rounder Musheer (2/35) tossed it up and got enough drift to tighten the noose around Bangladeshi batters. Musheer, younger brother Mumbai’s domestic stalwart Sarfaraz Khan, was a livewire on the field. He also effected a run-out. What was impressive to see was no overt celebrations from either Saumy or Musheer, who carried on their job like thoroughbred professionals. It was a fairly ill-tempered match with players from both sides indulging in sledging as the two teams have history of tension across senior men, senior women and U-19 level. For Indian team, it was a sweet revenge after losing the Asia Cup semi-final to Bangladesh. While the Indian batters found it difficult to get boundaries, the target was never below par as average score of teams batting first in Youth ODIs (U-19 ODI) at this ground was 201, and the highest successful chase being 243. In fact, India’s 251/7 on the day was the third highest score at this ground. The team’s designated finisher Sachin Dhas showed admirable technique and temperament during death overs with a nice little unbeaten cameo of 26 off 20 balls that took the score past 250-run mark. The pulled six off seamer Rohanat Doullah Borson was a treat for the eyes. This despite allowing Bangladeshi bowlers to bowl dot balls worth 26 overs during their innings. Left-arm seamer Maruf Mridha (5/43) did damage at the start and during slog overs by bowling in right areas but would be a bit miffed with his skipper, who got his calculations wrong and didn’t let him complete his quota of 10 overs. Possessing a skiddy action like Mustafizur Rahaman, Maruf varied his lengths, bowled closer to stumps at the start and mixed cutters with wide yorkers at the death to make life difficult for the India colts. The foundation of the Indian innings was laid by Adarsh (76 off 96 balls) and skipper Saharan (64 off 94 balls), who added 116 runs for the third wicket in nearly 23.5 overs. The two youngsters didn’t look comfortable against the Bangladesh spinners — offie Sheikh Paevez Jibon (0/39) and left-arm spinner Mahfuzur Rahaman Rabby (1/41). The two spinners didn’t let the set batters get away as Adarsh had six fours and Saharan only four. In fact, Indian batters got only 14 boundaries and two sixes in 50 overs but it proved to be enough in the end.Left-arm spinners Saumy Kumar Pandey and Musheer Khan headlined a dominant Indian performance as the defending champions outclassed Bangladesh by 84 runs in their opening game of the ICC U-19 World Cup here Saturday.While the total of 251 for 7 didn’t look big, the two Indian spinners choked the run-flow, shooting out ‘Tiger Cubs’ for a meagre 167 in 45.5 overs.Skipper Uday Saharan (64 off 94 balls) and left-handed opener Adarsh Singh (76 off 96 balls) hit half-centuries after Bangladesh invited the holders to take first strike.Saumy (4/24) was economical and bowled the lethal arm ball with a skiddy action while all-rounder Musheer (2/35) tossed it up and got enough drift to tighten the noose around Bangladeshi batters.Musheer, younger brother Mumbai’s domestic stalwart Sarfaraz Khan, was a livewire on the field.

https://www.dailypioneer.com//2024/sports/india-look-for-winning-start-against-bangladesh.html,India look for winning start against Bangladesh,"The most successful team in the Under-19 World Cup history, defending champions India will embark on a quest to add another trophy to their collection when a fresh bunch led by Uday Saharan takes on Bangladesh in their tournament-opener here on Saturday. Placed in Group A, the five-time winners will begin their campaign against the Asian rivals here at the Manguang Oval before they head into the other group fixtures against Ireland and the USA. Having won their first trophy in 2002 under Mohammad Kaif, Indian teams have have since gone on to win the U-19 World Cup in 2008, 2012, 2018 and 2022. The event, which was moved from Sri Lanka to South Africa in a late adjustment by the ICC, features four groups of as many teams each. The top three teams in each group will qualify for the Super Sixes, followed by the semifinals on February 6 and 8 with the final to be played at Benoni on February 11. With prodigious talent in Maharashtra all-rounder Arshin Kulkarni, wicketkeeper-batter Aravelly Avanish, left-arm spinner and vice-captain Saumy Kumar Pandey and Saharan, India will feel they have adequate arsenal to go the distance. Among these players, Kulkarni (Lucknow Supergiants) and Avinash (Chennai Super Kings) have already landed IPL deals and will be keen to make their mark on the biggest stage before they graduate to top-flight cricket. Saharan, who hails from Rajasthan but has led Punjab across age groups, has scored in excess of fifty in his last three innings which also includes a century against South Africa. Last November, the right-handed batter who shifted base from Rajasthan to Punjab, cracked 297 runs in just four matches of the U-19 Challenger Trophy at 99 with four fifties. Not far behind him was Mumbai’s Musheer Khan, another promising talent in this Indian side who raked up 268 runs at 89.33 with one century and two fifties in the domestic tournament. Among bowlers, each of Aaradhya Shukla, Pandey and Kulkarni were among the top wicket-takers in the U-19 Challenger Trophy before the Indian team made its way to South Africa. The team’s form also favours India with this bunch winning each of their four matches in the U-19 tri-nation series in South Africa. The final against the hosts was washed out. But India will also guard against complacency against Bangladesh having lost the U-19 Asia Cup semifinal in a largely one-sided contest in December. Bangladesh defeated Australia in its final warm-up game.

https://www.dailypioneer.com//2024/world/---bangladesh-polls-not-fair---.html,‘Bangladesh polls not fair’,"(): Even as India, Russia, China and several nations from Asia, Africa and South America greeted Sheikh Hasina for securing a historic fourth term as prime minister, the United Nations, the United States and the United Kingdom expressed their reservations terming the polls as “not free or fair.” Hasina’s Awami League (AL) won 223 seats in the 300-member Parliament on Sunday in the polls boycotted by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the main opposition. The Bangladesh government had invited a large number of foreign observers from India and other countries, as well as multilateral organisations, to observe the elections. The US State Department, in a press statement Monday, said that Washington remains concerned by the arrests of thousands of political opposition members and by reports of irregularities on election day in Bangladesh. “The United States shares the view with other observers that these elections were not free or fair and we regret that not all parties participated,” the State Department said. “We encourage the Government of Bangladesh to credibly investigate reports of violence and to hold perpetrators accountable. We also urge all political parties to reject violence,” it said. UN Human Rights Chief Volker Turk called on Bangladesh’s newly elected government to take steps to renew the country’s commitment to democracy and human rights, voicing distress that the environment for Sunday’s poll was marred by violence and repression of opposition candidates and supporters. “In the months leading up to the vote, thousands of opposition supporters have been detained arbitrarily or subjected to intimidation. Such tactics are not conducive to a truly genuine process,” Türk said and noted that democracy was “hard-won” in Bangladesh and “must not become cosmetic.” Around 25,000 opposition supporters have been arrested, the UN official said and raised serious concerns about possible torture  as at least 10 opposition supporters reportedly died – or were killed – in custody in the last two months. An associate spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Florencia Soto Niño, in response to a question on whether the UN believes the elections were free and fair, said, “We have seen the situation that’s unfolding there. The Secretary-General continues to follow what’s happening. He notes the opposition’s decision to boycott the elections.” She said the UN chief is “obviously concerned” about reports of incidents of violence prior to, and during the elections. The UK said that standards of credible and fair competition were not consistently met during Bangladesh’s 12th parliamentary elections. “Not all political parties took part in the elections. The Bangladeshi people did not therefore have the fullest range of voting options,” UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) said in a statement on Monday. It said democratic elections depend on credible, open, and fair competition and respect for human rights, the rule of law and due process are essential elements of the democratic process while “these standards were not consistently met during the election period.”  The FCDO statement also expressed concern at the “significant number of arrests of opposition party members before polling day.”  In contrast, there were greetings and applause that were showered on Hasina by India, China, Russia and several other countries from across Asia, West Asia, Africa and South America on Monday and Tuesday.  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called up his counterpart in person and congratulated her on her historic re-election on Monday and reiterated India’s commitment to further strengthen the “enduring and people-centric partnership” with its neighbour. Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe called the electoral triumph of Awami League a “testament to the trust and confidence bestowed by the people of Bangladesh in Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s capable leadership” and expressed confidence that “Hasina’s wisdom and wealth of experience will continue to benefit the people of Bangladesh.” A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman on Tuesday said Beijing congratulated Bangladesh for the successful holding of the election as planned and felicitated Awami League for winning the election. “As an amicable and close neighbour of Bangladesh, China firmly supports Bangladesh in implementing the political agendas in accordance with its law after the election,” she said.  According to the Bangladesh Prime Minister’s Office, ambassadors of Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, South Korea, Brunei, Malaysia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran, Qatar and Palestine called on the premier and greeted her for the election victory on Tuesday.  A Bangladesh PMO spokesman said ambassadors of India, Russia, China, Bhutan, the Philippines, Singapore and Sri Lanka called on the premier at her Ganobhaban residence on Monday and pledged continued support of their countries for Bangladesh.(): Even as India, Russia, China and several nations from Asia, Africa and South America greeted Sheikh Hasina for securing a historic fourth term as prime minister, the United Nations, the United States and the United Kingdom expressed their reservations terming the polls as “not free or fair.”Hasina’s Awami League (AL) won 223 seats in the 300-member Parliament on Sunday in the polls boycotted by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the main opposition.

The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by an ailing former prime minister Khaleda Zia, who is under house arrest on graft charges, had boycotted the polls calling it a “sham.” According to data available for previous elections, the 2008 elections, which installed Hasina’s Awami League (AL) to power, drew over 87 per cent votes. The subsequent 2014 polls, which were boycotted by BNP, drew over 40 per cent votes though Awami League candidates were elected uncontested in 153 out of the 300 seats. Over 80 per cent of voters turned out in the 2018 elections, the data showed. The BNP which had boycotted the 2014 election joined the process in 2018, which the party leaders later said was a mistake and alleged the voting was marred with widespread rigging and intimidation. According to the final result, Awami League candidates secured 223 seats, the parliamentary opposition Jatiya Party (JAPA) got 11 and independent candidates including ruling party rebels bagged 61 in the 300-seat parliament.Bangladesh’s opposition-boycotted general election on Sunday that re-elected Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s ruling Awami League for the fourth consecutive term registered a voter turnout of only 41.8 per cent, almost half compared to 2018 polls and the lowest since 1991.“According to the final count, the figure stands at 41.8 per cent,” Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal told a news briefing at his office on Monday. “If anyone doubts the number, you are most welcome to challenge it,” Awal said.

The fire broke out around midnight on Saturday at Kutupalong camp in Ukhiya and spread quickly, fanned by strong winds, Shafiqul Islam, head of the Ukhiya Fire Station, told The Associated Press. No casualties were reported, he said. “The fire was big, and it destroyed about 1,040 shelters in the camp,” he said. “We took about two hours to get the blaze under control, engaging 10 fire units from Ukhiya and other stations in the district.” An Associated Press reporter at the scene said that thousands of refugees, including women and children, rushed to a nearby open field with their belongings as the fire started spreading aggressively during the early hours on Sunday. “We are suffering from the cold severely, facing a difficult situation. Currently, we are sitting by a stream with my grandchildren after narrowly escaping a life-threatening situation. Our homes have been destroyed by the fire.” said 65-year-old Zuhura Begum. The United Nations’ refugee agency, UNHCR, said in an email to the AP that fire response volunteers worked with the firefighters to bring the blaze under control. An assessment of the extent of the damage is being made, it said. While it was not immediately clear how the fire started, Islam said that preliminary statements from the refugees suggested that it was caused by a mud oven. Fire in the refugee camps is common and in the past similar incidents have gutted thousands of homes. In March, a fire left thousands of refugees homeless temporarily. More than 1 million Rohingya refugees have fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar over several decades, including about 740,000 who crossed the border starting in late August 2017, when the Myanmar military launched a brutal crackdown. Conditions in Myanmar have worsened since a military takeover in 2021, and attempts to send back the refugees have failed. Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has said on several occasions that the refugees would not be sent back by force. Rights groups say conditions in Myanmar are not conducive for repatriation. Muslim Rohingya face widespread discrimination in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where they are denied citizenship and other constitutional rights. In 2022, the United States confirmed accounts of mass atrocities against civilians by the Myanmar military in a systematic campaign against the ethnic minority.

Presently, the country’s police force has around 2.13 lakh personnel, including civil staff, The Daily Star newspaper reported. A total of 1,89,000 police personnel have been deployed nationwide, who will be on election duty with magistrates on the voting day, besides patrolling and working in the strike teams, Deputy Inspector General (operation) at Police Headquarters, Anowar Hossain was quoted as saying by the newspaper. According to the bdnews24 news portal, 1,74,000 police personnel will be on duty without any leave, while the remaining 15,000 policemen will be engaged in routine work. Additional policemen and plainclothesmen have been deployed to the areas vulnerable to violence or irregularities, Hossain told the news portal. Since October 29, the ailing former premier Khaleda Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has held intermittent nationwide strikes and transport blockades. The BNP is boycotting the general elections after the government rejected its demand for an interim non-party neutral government to organise the voting. According to a media tally, 11 people died, 386 vehicles were torched, and four trains were derailed from tracks in the past two months in political violence. Police arrested thousands of opposition activists and figures, including de-facto BNP leader and party secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, over charges of violence. The BNP is carrying out an anti-election street campaign, calling for intermittent strikes and transport blockades, saying no election under the incumbent government led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina would be fair or neutral. It has also called for civil disobedience against the ruling Awami Party-led dispensation, urging people not to pay taxes and utility bills to press its demand for a non-party interim government for election oversight by amending the country’s Constitution. The BNP had boycotted the 2014 election but took part in the 2018 polls, which party leaders later said was a mistake, alleging that the voting was marred with widespread rigging and intimidation. On Friday, Bangladesh deployed 1,151 platoons of paramilitary border guards across the country to ensure that the general election is held in a free, fair and peaceful manner. The Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) personnel will work in tandem with the police, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), and armed forces for 13 days surrounding the January 7 polls. The US and other major Western countries called for dialogue between the ruling Awami League and particularly with the BNP to ensure an inclusive and credible election, which, however, saw no headway due to reluctance from both sides. With the BNP boycotting the election and no other credible opposition party against it, Hasina’s Awami League is likely to gain an upper hand and will likely form the government for the fourth consecutive term.  Bangladesh has deployed more than 1.89 lakh policemen to ensure law and order ahead of the January 7 general election being boycotted by the main opposition BNP, media reports said on Sunday.Presently, the country’s police force has around 2.13 lakh personnel, including civil staff, The Daily Star newspaper reported.

https://www.dailypioneer.com//2024/sports/new-zealand-beats-bangladesh-by-17-runs.html,New Zealand beats Bangladesh by 17 runs,"Mitchell Santner and Jimmy Neesham combined in a 46-run partnership which steered New Zealand to a 17 run win over Bangladesh under the Duckworth-Lewis system in the third Twenty20 international on Sunday, dashing the Tigers’ hopes of their first series win in New Zealand. Captain Santner and Neesham provided the cool heads New Zealand needed to overcome another top-order collapse and chase down Bangladesh’s inadequate total of only 110 in a race against encroaching dark clouds and rain. New Zealand was in desperate trouble at 49-5 in the ninth over, trailing under the Duckworth-Lewis system when Neesham and Santner came together. They stayed together and guided New Zealand to 95-5 in the 15th over when the forecast rain arrived torrentially and brought the match to an abrupt end. “I think we always knew there was going to be a bit of rain around whether it came at the end of halfway through that second innings,” Santner said. “The bowlers did the job up front and it was good to get across the line in a pretty hard-fought series.” In extraordinary scenes, spectators dashed for the exits of Bay Oval as the rain pelted down, driven by strong winds. New Zealand needed 78 runs to be ahead on the Duckworth-Lewis calculation. Sunday’s win leveled the three-match series at 1-1 after Bangladesh won the first match by five wickets and after the second match at Bay Oval was washed out after 11 overs. But New Zealand can no longer turn a blind eye to the failings of its top order in the ongoing absence of Kane Williamson and Devon Conway. Bangladesh may have lost the three-match one-day international series and shared the T20 series, but it achieved its first wins in New Zealand in both formats. In the third ODI, New Zealand was reduced to 70-6 and in the first T20 it was 50-5 as its top batters failed to master the Bangladesh attack. The latest collapse seemed both inevitable and at times comical. Santner excelled as New Zealand bowled out Bangladesh for only 110 in 19.2 overs after winning the toss. Bangladesh lost three wickets for 45 runs in the power play then was bogged down in the middle overs, scoring only 32 between the seventh and 16th overs. Najmul Hossain Shanto’s 17 from 15 balls was the top score. Four other batsmen reached double figures, including Towhid Hridoy who made 16 from 18 balls. Santner was particularly effective in the middle stages and there was enough grass on the pitch at Bay Oval for the ball to grip and turn a little. Santner took 4-16 from his four overs while the seamers Tim Southee, Adam Mile and Ben Sears shared six wickets. “Bowling into the wind can be challenging at times but I was thinking of changing the pace and trying to get a bit of bounce out of the wicket,” Santner said. “As a whole the seamers bowled extremely well as well to keep them to 110 on a pretty good pitch.” Santner surprised a little when he chose to field on winning the toss. Bay Oval usually is a bat-first pitch with an average first innings score of 190. But with rain forecast, bowling gave New Zealand some control. In the end it was decisive and New Zealand became the first team to win a T20 at Bay Oval when batting second. But, matching the forecast, New Zealand made heavy weather of an apparently easy run chase. Tim Seifert fell in the second over, then Daryl Mitchell, Glenn Phillips and Mark Chapman fell in quick succession. All four batsmen were out for 1. Chapman’s dismissal had an element of the comic as he collided with Finn Allen in mid-pitch as Allen crossed over and ran down the wrong side of the wicket. Chapman had no hope of making his ground. Allen made 38 from 31 balls but might not have fully atoned for Chapman’s dismissal. When Allen missed a straight ball and was bowled by Shoriful Islam in the ninth over, New Zealand was in deep trouble. But Neesham and Santner had the composure to get the run chase done. Shanto made a tactical blunder when he bowled himself in the 10th over and the Kiwi pair plundered 14 runs from his part-time off breaks to move ahead on the Duckworth Lewis tally.Mitchell Santner and Jimmy Neesham combined in a 46-run partnership which steered New Zealand to a 17 run win over Bangladesh under the Duckworth-Lewis system in the third Twenty20 international on Sunday, dashing the Tigers’ hopes of their first series win in New Zealand.Captain Santner and Neesham provided the cool heads New Zealand needed to overcome another top-order collapse and chase down Bangladesh’s inadequate total of only 110 in a race against encroaching dark clouds and rain.New Zealand was in desperate trouble at 49-5 in the ninth over, trailing under the Duckworth-Lewis system when Neesham and Santner came together.

Ailing former premier Khaleda Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is carrying out an anti-election street campaign, calling for intermittent strikes and transport blockades, saying no election under the incumbent government led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina would be fair or neutral. The BNP has also called for civil disobedience against the Awami Party-led dispensation, urging people not to pay taxes and utility bills to press its demand for a non-party interim government for election oversight by amending the country’s Constitution. The BNP is boycotting the election after its demand for an interim non-party neutral government to organise the voting was rejected by the government. The party had boycotted the 2014 election but took part in 2018 polls, which party leaders later said was a mistake alleging that the voting was marred with widespread rigging and intimidation.  Since October 29, the BNP has been holding intermittent nationwide strikes and transport blockades. According to a media tally, 11 people died, 386 vehicles were torched, and four trains were derailed from tracks in the past two months in political violence. Police arrested thousands of opposition activists and figures, including de-facto BNP leader and party secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, over charges of violence. Hasina, 76, also the President of the Awami Party, alleged that BNP is hatching conspiracies from abroad, in an apparent reference to the party’s acting chairman and Zia’s son Tarique Rahman who has taken refuge in the UK to evade jail terms. Several Bangladeshi courts declared Rahman a “fugitive” as he took refuge in the UK to evade jail terms for several criminal charges, including a grenade attack on a rally of the then-opposition Awami League in 2004 in which 24 people were killed. Hasina narrowly escaped the attack, which also wounded some 500 of her party leaders, activists and supporters.Bangladesh on Friday deployed a total of 1,151 platoons of paramilitary border guards across the country to ensure that the January 7 general election can be held in a free, fair and peaceful manner amid a boycott by the main Opposition BNP and its allies.The Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) personnel will work in tandem with the police, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), and armed forces for 13 days surrounding the January 7 polls, starting on Friday. Typically, each platoon consists of around 30 BGB troopers.

https://www.dailypioneer.com//2023/world/hasina-pledges-to-build----smart-bangladesh---.html,Hasina pledges to build ‘Smart Bangladesh’,"Bangladesh Prime Minister and ruling Awami League’s president Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday launched her party’s poll manifesto, pledging to build a “Smart Bangladesh” if elected for a fourth consecutive term in the January 7 general elections, being boycotted by the main opposition BNP. “Come; once again allow us to serve you by voting for the ‘boat’, the election symbol of the Awami League,” Hasina, along with senior party leaders and sympathisers, said while unveiling her party’s poll manifesto in a crowded press conference. “You vote for us; we will give you development, peace, and prosperity,” Hasina, 76, said, adding that her party does not believe in rhetoric, but implements whatever it promises. The Awami League coined “Smart Bangladesh: Development is visible, now employment will enhance” as the theme for the manifesto, setting 11 priorities for building a modern, technology-oriented country, and pledges to modernise the healthcare sector with a “universal health system”. “In the 2008 election manifesto, we announced Vision 2021, which was a charter of change. We successfully ran the country after overcoming hundreds of hurdles by winning the 2014 and 2018 elections,” Hasina said. Meanwhile, ailing former premier Khaleda Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is carrying out an anti-election street campaign, calling for intermittent strikes and transport blockades, saying no election under the incumbent government would be fair or neutral.

The party had boycotted the 2014 election but took part in 2018 polls, which party leaders later said was a mistake alleging that the voting was marred with widespread rigging and intimidation. Launching the manifesto, Hasina criticised the Opposition, saying, “Whenever the election comes, an anti-liberation, anti-Bangladesh, and anti-development circle becomes active with a leap of conspiracy.” She said ahead of the polls every time, the Opposition appeared in the political landscape to grab the state power through back doors and “if unsuccessful, they jump on the people in the spirit of revenge”.“They want to intimidate the public through arson, vehicle burning, bombing, sabotage, or terrorist activities. This time was no exception,” Hasina said. Since October 29, the BNP has been holding intermittent nationwide strikes and transport blockades.

With the BNP boycotting the election, and no other credible opposition party against it, Hasina’s Awami League is likely to gain an upper hand and likely to form the government for the fourth consecutive term. BNP’s boycott of polls had initially exposed the Awami League to a challenge of legitimising the January 7 polls as the Jatiya Party (JAPA), which is officially or technically the main opposition in the current Parliament, was also reluctant to take part in the upcoming elections. However, earlier this month, Awami League decided to spare 26 out of the 300 parliamentary seats to JAPA in an apparent effort to persuade the party to take part in the January 7 elections in BNP’s absence, while its nominees withdrew their candidature from these seats. Political analysts opined that the JAPA’s previous stance of unwillingness to contest the polls was a bargaining technique.

https://www.dailypioneer.com//2023/sports/bangladesh-beats-new-zealand-by-5-wickets.html,Bangladesh beats New Zealand by 5 wickets,"Litton Das carried his bat for 42 to steer Bangladesh to a five-wicket win in the opening Twenty20 International on Wednesday as it rolled New Zealand out cheaply at McLean Park for the second time in four days. On Saturday, Bangladesh bowled out New Zealand for 98 on the same pitch to set up a nine-wicket win in the third one-day international, its first limited-overs victory over the Black Caps on their home soil. Four days later, Bangladesh claimed three wickets with the first nine balls of the New Zealand innings and contained the home side to 134 for nine. The Black Caps were one for three after Shoriful Islam dismissed Finn Allen and Glenn Phillips with consecutive balls in the second over, and then 20 for four following the fall of Daryl Mitchell. Jimmy Neesham made 48 and captain Mitchell Santner 23 as New Zealand staged a partial recovery. Das led an unhurried run chase that saw Bangladesh reach its target with eight balls to spare. The opener was given out lbw to Tim Southee when he was 22 but had the decision reversed under review and stayed on to steady the innings later. He needed medical treatment for a leg injury at the start of the 18th over when he was 29 and Bangladesh needed 24 from 18 balls. On 33, and with 20 needed from 16 balls, his lofted shot found Ish Sodhi at fine-leg but the fielder stepped over the boundary line in completing a simple catch, giving Das another reprieve. Clearly impeded while running between the wickets, Das was able to look on from the non-striker’s end as Mahedi Hasan (19 not out) finished the chase with a six and a four off Adam Milne in the 19th over. Earlier, Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto entrusted the first over to off-spinner Mahedi and the decision paid off when he bowled Tim Seifert with the fourth ball. “In these conditions, spin bowling is hard, but I was able to get my execution right,” said Mahedi who was Player of the Match for his all-round performance. “I hit the right areas in the power play and was able to do a good job for my team. When I bowl well, then I am able to bat confidently and finish the job for my team.” Seifert went back to a delivery from Mahedi that he tried to dab wide of slip. But, the ball kept low, skipped on and hit his middle stump. Shoriful then followed up his effort in the third one-dayer, where he took three wickets, with a double strike in the second over. Allen threw his hands, without moving his feet, to a ball going across him and was caught at slip. Next ball Phillips offered no shot to a delivery that struck him on the knee roll in front of the middle. New Zealand called for a review, but Phillips had begun to walk off the field before the decision was made. When Mitchell was bowled by Mahedi, New Zealand was in desperate trouble. Neesham lifted the Black Caps with his 48 from 29 balls, which included four fours and three sixes. But, he was out just when the innings seemed to be gaining momentum, at 110 for seven in the 17th over. Shanto (19), Soumya Sarkar (22) and Towhid Hridoy (19) made valuable contributions for Bangladesh but Das held the innings together when it seemed it might falter. Afif Hossain fell to Southee in the 15th over when the visitors were 97 for five and Das had his successful review later in the same over, a turning point in the match.

https://www.dailypioneer.com//2023/page1/bsf-to-man-bangladesh-border-along-sundarbans.html,BSF to man Bangladesh border along Sundarbans,"In view of continued smuggling and infiltration along the Indo-Bangladesh frontier, the Border Security Force has decided to set up a marine battalion to man the strategic, yet hostile terrains of the Sundarbans mangrove forests. The conceived battalion will consist of 1,100 personnel, along with a squadron of about 40 drones and all-terrain vehicles or ATVs, as per officials. The blueprint of the plan has been prepared by the BSF’s Eastern Command and sent to the Union Home Ministry for approval. “The Sundarbans is a strategic and vital area along the India-Bangladesh international border. Its effective domination and security are the need of the hour, given inputs suggesting that this tricky forest and riverine area could be used for cross-border infiltration of terrorists and criminals,” said a senior BSF officer. In addition to seeking approval from the Home Ministry, the BSF has written to the Bengal Government, seeking permission to station a small team of its patrol parties (personnel on foot patrol) inside Forest Department ‘chowkis’ located inside the Sundarbans, often approachable by motorboats. One of the most treacherous forests in the world, thanks to its complex network of tidal backwaters several kilometers wide, narrow tidal creeks, and channels, the Sundarbans lies on the delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers at the mouth of the Bay of Bengal. A cluster of low-lying islands, the Sundarbans spans about 10,000 sq km across India and Bangladesh, with 40 per cent of it lying in this part of the border. Last December, the BSF set up a floating border outpost or BOP deep inside the Sundarbans, named BOP Ganga, which is an all-women border outpost comprising an 11-member patrol team. It was the first time in the history of the paramilitary forces that a platoon of Mahila Praharis (women constables) was deployed for border patrolling and operation of a floating BOP in difficult terrain like the Sundarbans, according to a former DIG, BSF. He said the difficult zone, infested with a hostile climate, muddy tidal land, Royal Bengal Tigers, crocodiles, and poisonous snakes, made the task of the security forces even more challenging. “We had started a border outpost at Shamsherganj quite a few years ago, but with the rising activities of smuggling and infiltration through snorkeling and many other ways, it has become most imperative to devise newer ideas to keep things under control. The special battalion will precisely meet the requirements,” he said.In view of continued smuggling and infiltration along the Indo-Bangladesh frontier, the Border Security Force has decided to set up a marine battalion to man the strategic, yet hostile terrains of the Sundarbans mangrove forests.The conceived battalion will consist of 1,100 personnel, along with a squadron of about 40 drones and all-terrain vehicles or ATVs, as per officials.
