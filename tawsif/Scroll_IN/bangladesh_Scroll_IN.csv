Everyone expected it – they finished at the top of the table and qualified directly for the final. They were led by Australia’s most successful captain and boasted some incredible talent in their squad including Jemimah Rodrigues, Marizanne Kapp, Shafali Verma and Jess Jonnasen.But it was a determined Harmanpreet Kaur and Mumbai Indians who ultimately pipped them to the title. Come Season 2 that begins on February 23, Delhi Capitals will be hoping the small additions they’ve made to the squad in the auction in December will prove fruitful.One of the two teams that enter the tournament with a full-strength squad, Lanning and Co will be hoping to get things off to a flyer when they face Mumbai Indians in a repeat of last year’s final at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru.Because of the depth that their squad possesses, the Delhi camp made only three buys in the auction in December – the biggest being Australia’s Annabel Sutherland who was picked up for Rs 2 Cr. With their remaining purse, Delhi bought back Bengal wicketkeeper Aparna Mondal and also took in Ashwani Kumari.A few concerns lay ahead of the second season with Lanning having not played much since her retirement last year. Kapp too is in doubt of making the starting game, having been ruled out of the one-off Test between South Africa and Australia due to undisclosed reasons.Also read: WPL 2024: Format, schedule, squads – All you need to know about the second editionThe biggest strength that last year’s runners-up have is their all-round abilities. The squad has power hitters in Verma and Rodrigues, the latter having had a good home season in the series against England and Australia.Alongside these two, the foreign all-rounders in Sutherland, Kapp and Jonnasen boast of dominant skills with the bat and ball. Sutherland is coming off an incredible double century in the one-off Test against South Africa in Perth.In the overall pace department, Delhi will be led by Shikha Pandey, one of India’s more successful bowlers, but will have the likes of Kapp and youngster Titas Sadhu for support. Sadhu in particular will be a valuable resource for Lanning, as she was for India during the 2022 Asian Games final against Sri Lanka that saw the Indian women’s team win gold in Hangzhou, China.Poonam Yadav and Minnu Mani make up the spinners department with the latter having made her India debut against Bangladesh after the first WPL season. A year’s worth of international match experience will definitely come in handy but spinners rarely have a good time at both the Bengaluru and Delhi stadiums with their speedy outfields and smaller boundaries.Alice Capsey is also another wildcard who is handy with both the ball and bat for England. The 19-year-old is similar to Jonnasen in the skills she offers to the squad with her off-break bowling and batting abilities, which could be another positive for Lanning and Co.If there is a weakness to be picked on in this squad, it is their over-reliance on Lanning and Verma to strike big at the top. This was their downfall in the final last year, where the dismissal of the Australian saw Delhi lose four wickets before Pandey and Radha Yadav put on that brilliant 52-run partnership for the last wicket.The duo are once again likely to open the batting with Rodrigues and Kapp coming in at three and four, making it a strong top-order line-up, one that will relish the pitches in Bengaluru and later on, in Delhi. But they will need to take care that they don’t rely too much on their openers with the presence of other equally able batters.Players to watch out for: Titas Sadhu: The youngster was the star of the first Twenty20 International against Australia last month when she picked up figures of 4/17 to demolish the visitors’ top order. Sadhu definitely has the ability to pick up key wickets in tight situations and could impress as one of the two main fast bowlers for Delhi.Annabel Sutherland: It is a testament to Australia’s batting line-up that Sutherland hasn’t had much of a chance in the last few months to wield the bat until that mammoth Test innings. But the Australian all-rounder has the capability to build on the foundation set by the top order and pick up wickets with her medium pace bowling.

https://scroll.in/article/1063970/why-assams-muslims-see-discrimination-in-states-flagship-scheme-for-the-rural-landless,Why Assam’s Muslims see discrimination in state’s flagship scheme for the rural landless ,"In August last year, Md Ruhul Amin and Shaiful Islam applied for rights to the land on which they have lived for over two decades in their villages in Lower Assam’s Barpeta district.They did so through the Assam government’s flagship scheme, Mission Basundhara, which allows the state to regularise land held by cultivators and other occupants without land titles. Under the scheme, the state allocates government land to citizens if they fulfil certain conditions – a process known as settlement of land.Amin had applied for a title to 0.03875 acres of government land in Metuakuchi village, a plot on which his house stands. He was in possession of the plot since 1999 and has been paying taxes since then. Scroll has seen copies of the tax receipts.The decision to grant land rights is taken by the district-level sub-divisional land advisory committee, headed by the district commissioner and with legislators of the area as members.According to the rules of Mission Basundhara, the conversion of government khas land to myadi land – that is, land to which a person has ownership rights and which can be bought and sold – in rural areas shall be made only to those applicants who can prove that they are residents of Assam for three generations and who have been in continuous occupation of the land for a minimum of three years from the date of application.Like Amin, Islam, a 45-year-old police constable, was in possession of .3095 acres of land at Metuakuchi village for over 25 years. Two decades ago, his family had migrated from his native village at Baghbar in Barpeta district after the village was swallowed up by the Brahmaputra river. “We have been paying tax since 1999,” Islam said. Scroll has seen the tax receipts.On November 6, the land advisory committee in Barpeta approved an initial list of applications of 42 people in the entire Barpeta district. This included Amin and Islam. Scroll has seen the list of names cleared by the panel.But two months later, Amin and Islam’s applications were rejected by the same committee.“All the Hindu applicants’ names were cleared and they were given land,” Amin told Scroll. “We don’t know why our applications were rejected.”On February 8, two Muslim legislators from Barpeta district, Ashraful Hussain and Sherman Ali Ahmed, brought up the case of Amin and Islam in the state Assembly, arguing that the rejection points towards discrimination against Muslims.“There were 42 names proposed for the land titles under Mission Basundhara 2.0 and the list was cleared by the sub-divisional land advisory committee or SDLAC,” said Hussain, the Chenga MLA and a member of the committee, in the Assembly.He added: “However, the applicants from a particular community have been rejected while people from only one community were selected for the land settlement. We have heard that Muslims will not qualify for the land under Basundhara. Are we even a democracy and secular country anymore?”Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma’s response to the question was startling. He declared that landless Bengali-origin Muslims cannot apply for land under the Mission Basundhara as they are not “indigenous”.According to the 2011 Census, there are 1.06 crore Muslims in Assam – accounting for 34.22% of the state’s population. Most of them are Muslims of Bengali origin. Although their families have been living in Assam’s riverine areas since much before Independence, they are often branded as illegal migrants, and are among the most marginalised communities in the state. “The definition is clear,” Sarma said. “Khilonjia [indigenous] means aboriginal. In Assam, the tribal people...[communities such as] the Moran, Matak and Chutia are aboriginal. This is a worldwide recognised definition.”The chief minister said that “Miyas”, a derogatory term for Bengali-origin Muslims, are citizens but not indigenous to Assam.Legislators and experts pointed out that Sarma was introducing a new, exclusionary definition of “indigenous” that is neither valid in Indian law nor has been part of the rules of Mission Basundhara since 2021, when it was first introduced in Assam.More worryingly, district-wise data on the implementation of the scheme suggests that, in practice, Bengali-origin Muslims are being denied land settlement under the scheme.They are not the only community with concerns about the scheme. The chief minister also went on to say that landless Muslims from ethnic Assamese communities should not take the Basundhara route – but directly apply to the district administration for land titles.On February 15, a week after Sarma’s remarks, the Sadou Asom Goriya Moria Deshi Jatiya Parishad, a group claiming to represent the interest of “indigenous” or ethnic Assamese Muslims, held protests across the state against the alleged discrimination against them under Mission Basundhara. “Just because we have Ali, Ahmed as surnames, are we not indigenous?” asked Sahid Ali Ahmed, the vice-president of the organisation.For decades, land has been at the centre of the ethnic Assamese anxiety over undocumented immigration and fuelled hostility towards Bengali-origin Muslims.In the 1930s, hundreds of Muslim peasants from what is present-day Bangladesh were settled by the British in Assam’s sparsely populated and fertile plains to “grow more food”.After Independence, the question of who is indigenous to the state and who has claims to its resources has roiled Assam’s politics several times. The ethnic Assamese communities – both Hindus and Muslims – believe that the alleged unchecked influx of undocumented migrants poses an existential threat to the state and their identity. This anxiety was behind the widespread support for a National Register of Citizens, which left out 19.06 lakh residents of Assam in 2019.For the purpose of the second phase of the Mission Basundhara scheme, according to the state revenue department notification issued on November 11, 2022 , “a person whose family has been residing in the state continuously for the last three generations or more as on January 1, 2022, will be regarded as indigenous person for getting settlement of land.”“They have set an arbitrary criteria to determine ‘indigeneity’ while settling certain lands,” said Vasundhara Jairath, who teaches Development Studies at the Indian Institute of Technology in Guwahati. “But even going by that definition, the scheme does not automatically exclude Miya Muslims.”When Amin applied for land allotment to the district administration in January 2021, he was told to take the Mission Basundhara route. “We were not given land titles as we were told by district officials that we will be eligible under the Basundhara scheme,” he said.Among the documents an applicant can submit under the Basundhara scheme to support this claim is a genuine refugee certificate prior to March 25, 1971, given to those who fled East Pakistan in the 1950s and 1960s, or proof that the applicant’s families were included in the 1951 National Register of Citizens.The first NRC was compiled exclusively for Assam in 1951 to check undocumented immigration from across the porous border with East Pakistan, in the years after Partition.Amin had submitted documents that showed “family linkage” with residents included in the 1951 NRC, as well as voter lists of 1966, 1971, 1997 and 2019. His father and grandfather’s names appear in the older voter lists.Amin’s name was cleared by the land advisory committee, headed by the district commissioner, on November 6. But, according to the online application status at Sewa Setu, his application was rejected on January 14 by the same committee.“January 14 was a Sunday. There was no SDLAC meeting on that day, according to other members of the panel,” Amin said.The reason cited for the rejection was that the land applied for is “already reserved for government or public purpose”.However, in a letter written on September 13, 2021, the then circle officer of Barpeta revenue circle had noted that there was “no public institution” at the proposed land sought by Amin. The circle officer also mentioned that Amin is a “landless indigenous” [sic]. Scroll has seen the letter.Amin pointed out that the plot he had applied for was a part of a land parcel, called Dag number 1302. “In the past, other people have got plots in the same land parcel,” he said.According to land records, known as Jamabandi, which Scroll has seen, two residents of the village, Mukuli Basfor and Indrajit Chandra Das, were given land titles in 2007 and 2017 to plots of the same parcel (Dag number 1302).“We don't know why our applications were rejected despite the fact that we met all the requisite conditions. We should get the land,” Amin said.Scroll called and texted the Barpeta district commissioner, asking for a response to Amin and Islam’s queries. There was no response. In the second phase of Mission Basundhara, the government received 13.39 lakh applications for land titles. So far, 2.29 lakh people have been granted land titles.Of those, 2.07 lakh got land titles under the “settlement of government khas and ceiling surplus land” category.An analysis of the data uploaded on the Basundhara dashboard and statements by the state revenue minister in the state Assembly reveals that the rejection rate in districts with a sizeable population of Bengali-origin Muslims is significantly higher than that of Upper Assam districts, inhabited by the ethnic Assamese and tribal communities.In Dhemaji district, which is home to ethnic communities, over 40% applicants were given land titles – 43,085 applicants out of 1.07 lakh were selected.Similarly, 38.5% applicants got land titles in Dibrugarh district and 36.4% in Tinsukia district.In contrast, only 0.23 per cent applicants in the Muslim-majority Barpeta district were approved – 82 people got land titles, though 35,246 had applied.Similarly, only 2% of the total 77,180 applicants were eligible for the land titles in Muslim-majority Dhubri district.In Barak Valley’s Karimganj, a Muslim-majority district, a total of 13,361 applications were received, out of which 383 people were given land under Mission Basundhara 2.0. Only one of them was Muslim.Government officials, however, deny any bias in the implementation of the scheme.According to Gyanendra Dev Tripathi, commissioner and secretary to state revenue and disaster management department, which is responsible for implementing the Mission Basundhara, the most common reason for rejection was that the applicants could not prove that they had been living for three generations in Assam.“About 4,67,000 people [applicants in Mission Basundhara] could not prove that they were residents for three generations,” Tripathi told Scroll.Many others, he said, applied for land which was part of the village grazing reserve or professional grazing reserve – which cannot be settled or turned into private land.He denied any instances of Muslim applicants being excluded. “There is no such case to my notice. Both Hindu and Muslim applicants were rejected when they could not prove they have been Assam residents for three generations.”In 2022, too, the All India Democratic Front, or AIUDF, had accused the BJP of communalising land settlement, by excluding people living on chars – the shifting riverine islands on the Brahmaputra – from the scheme. Majuli was exempt from this rule.Not surprisingly, under Mission Basundhara 2.0, not a single applicant was selected for land titles in South Salmara-Mankachar, the western Assam district bordering Bangladesh which has almost 95% Muslim population.South Salmara Mankachar is one of the worst erosion-hit districts in the state. Thousands of its residents live on chars and have been rendered homeless over the years due to the erosion of their lands.While raising Amin and Islam’s cases in the Assembly, AIUDF legislator Ashraful Hussain criticised this older rule. “This is just a conspiracy to not to give land to the Muslims people who live on the chars,” he said. “Why is it that land pattas can be given in Majuli but not in other char areas? All landless should be given land.”In 2016, the Bharatiya Janata Party made the protection of land as one of its main poll planks, with the slogan jati (identity), maati (land), bheti (hearth).After coming to power, the BJP-led government under Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal carried out a series of eviction drives, which disproportionately targeted Muslims. According to government data, between May 2016 and July 2021, about 4,700 families, mostly Muslim, were evicted from government land.Under the new BJP government headed by Himanta Biswa Sarma, the evictions against Muslims became more regular, sometimes violent.Between May 2021, when Sarma became chief minister, and February this year, more than 9,200 families, overwhelmingly Bengalis of Muslim origin, have been evicted for allegedly encroaching government land.In case of the Dhalpur eviction, the government not only evicted over 1,000 Muslim peasant families from land which they had been cultivating for generations, but allowed the indigenous people to take over the land by forming a state-run community farming project.In the backdrop of these evictions, the purported exclusion of Bengali Muslims from Mission Basundhara only adds to their marginalisation, say leaders of the community.Ashraful Hussain, the legislator from All India United Democratic Front, pointed out that thousands of Muslims of Bengali origin are losing their homes due to erosion and flood.“Those who are on government lands are being evicted without rehabilitation,” he added. “The government is not giving land titles to the landless Muslims. This is double discrimination and there is no hope in sight.”Jairath from IIT and Muslim legislators alleged that Sarma’s remarks were aimed to polarise the voter in upcoming elections. “The Chief Minister is actively spreading disinformation about the scheme, to ensure it will be implemented in partisan ways and to aid in the dynamic of electoral politics,” said Jairath. “It is not a welfare scheme meant only for certain sections of people, but for all citizens.”For the so-called indigenous Muslims of Assam, the chief minister’s remarks have come as an unpleasant surprise.In 2022, the Sarma granted indigenous status to about 40 lakh Assamese-speaking Muslims in the state, from five Muslim groups, to distinguish them from the Bengali-origin Muslim community.“Are indigenous people subject to religious discrimination now?” asked Ahmed, the vice-president of Sadou Asom Goriya Moria Deshi Jatiya Parishad.About 1,500 Muslims belonging to the Goriya, Moriya and Deshi Muslim communities had applied for the land titles under Mission Basundhara 2.0, Ahmed claimed. “But not even 1% made it to the list.”An official at Bilasipara circle office in Dhubri district told Scroll that not a single applicant belonging to the Desi Muslim community has been selected for land under the scheme last year. All the selected applicants are Hindus from Koch Rajbongshi, Bengali Hindus, tribals or Assamese communities.“Many applications belonging to the Desi Muslim community were passed by the circle officer as they met with the eligible criteria,” the official told Scroll on condition of anonymity. “However, there was pressure and orders from higher authorities to reject the applications,” he allegedWhile the BJP has claimed that its schemes do not discriminate against any community, Muslim legislators in the state see a systemic exclusion of Muslims.“The denial of land to the Muslims under Basundhara is just one incident,” said Baghbar MLA Sherman Ali Ahmed.“There is systematic deprivation in a massive way. Not a single road under Asom Mala [ a programme to develop state highways and district roads] has been allocated in a Muslim area,” he alleged. “It is the principle of RSS-BJP to make Muslims second-class citizens.”Several others pointed out that Muslims are being excluded by design by the Assam government.For example, the newly announced Mukhyamantri Mahila Udyamita Abhiyaan, a scheme for promoting women entrepreneurs excludes all women who have more than three children.Under the scheme, the state will provide an entrepreneurship fund of Rs 10,000 to 39.67 lakh women members of self-help groups in the rural areas subject to certain conditions. Once they avail this benefit, a bank loan of minimum of Rs 25,000 will be provided to the beneficiary.For Scheduled Tribe or Scheduled Caste applicants, however, the criteria is relaxed – women with more than four children are ineligible for the scheme.“This will definitely exclude many Muslim women in the villages,” said Aminul Islam, the AIUDF MLA from Mankachar. “They are creating separate categories of citizens, by arbitrarily deciding who will be eligible for government schemes or land under Basundhara. All this is government-sponsored discrimination.”A similar separate category appears to be on the way in Mission Basundhara. On February 14, chief minister Sarma announced in the Assembly that tea tribes, Adivasis and the Gorkha community will not need to produce documents proving their residence in Assam going back to three generations in the upcoming version of Mission Basundhara. “We will allocate land to these two communities without asking for documents in the third phase of Mission Basundhara,” he said.",The Assam chief minister recently declared that neither Bengali-origin nor ethnic Assamese Muslims qualify for the scheme.

https://scroll.in/article/1063967/how-one-man-is-spreading-bangla-education-among-the-tribes-of-the-chittagong-hills-in-bangladesh,How one man is spreading Bangla education among the tribes of the Chittagong Hills in Bangladesh,"Morning sunlight on the misty valleys turned the forested slopes into a tapestry of gold. On a hilltop, a lone figure emerged, descending a snake-like trail in the distance.The figure hoisted his weathered bag onto his head and cautiously approached the Jhiri – a narrow river with a fierce current and treacherous boulders. With practiced ease, he navigated the rushing water, emerging on the opposite bank and ascending another knoll.A small bamboo house with a red roof stood on that elevated ground. The man paused before it, produced a key from his worn pocket and unlocked the gate.Unseen, I witnessed this from a distance. It was the crack of dawn in Shiplampi, a quiet hilltop village in Bangladesh’s southeastern district of Bandarban. The trekking group I was part of had stopped there the night before, en route to Tajindong, one of the country’s highest peaks.Fitful sleep had driven me outside the village headman's house to breathe in the cool morning air.The red-roofed house, a mystery from afar, finally revealed its purpose. It was a school and the man who unlocked its gate was its sole guardian, Maijesh Tripura. Curiosity piqued, I ventured closer.Inside was a modest but purposeful space. Ten to 12 wooden benches faced a blackboard, flanked by a map of Bangladesh and a portrait of Jesus Christ. A medium-sized cross hung on the wall, completing the picture.Tripura knelt before the cross, his head bowed in silent prayer. I waited patiently, the silence broken only by the rustle of leaves outside.Moments later, he rose, his gaze meeting mine. His clothes, though worn, seemed less ragged close up. Thin, grey hair framed his face, contrasting with a lean, muscular build. A smile, reminiscent of a monk’s serenity, played on his lips.“Good morning,” he said warmly.Tripura, a young boy from Bangladesh’s ethnic Tripura tribe, had dared to dream beyond the traditional life of slash-and-burn agriculture and hunting in the remote Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh.He saw education as the key to a brighter future, inspired by a Christian non-profit school that he encountered in a neighboring village. Despite initial resistance from his parents, Tripura’s determination was unwavering. He persuaded them to let him attend the school in Saikotpara – a Bom tribal village nearby – where he studied Bangla, English and mathematics.His dedication caught the eye of a priest who recognised his potential and enrolled him in the Thanchi Bazaar school close by. Tripura successfully completed his matriculation exam.But driven by a desire to bring education to his own community, Tripura returned to his home village of Sherkorpara after his matriculation set up a school. The villagers readily supported his endeavour, providing land and building a school.But a major hurdle emerged: the lack of study materials. Most villagers were too poor to afford books and other supplies, and even finding them in Thanchi Bazaar proved difficult.Undeterred, Tripura sought help from the non-profit that had inspired him in Saikotpara. They provided funding for benches, blackboards and study material, transforming the school into a government-registered primary school.Today, the school boasts of six teachers with government salaries, and the Tripura tribe in Sherkorpara is flourishing, with many villagers running successful businesses in Thanchi Bazaar.Tripura did not stop at just building a school in his own village of Sherkorpara. His real mission was bigger: to empower underprivileged communities through education, particularly by spreading the Bangla language. He believed that exposure to Bangla could unlock a world of opportunities for these marginalised ethnic groups.“I wanted to spread the light of education among other tribes, especially the Mro, who have the highest illiteracy rate,” he said. He came to Shiplampi, convinced the Karbari, or chieftain, to donate land. With the help of the nonprofit, he built a school and acquired learning material.Tripura now treks four hours from his village to Shiplampi thrice a week to teach Bangla, English and mathematics to the students. His goal is to prepare them for primary schools in larger villages and Thanchi Bazaar.“I don’t charge any fees,” he said. ""My only purpose is to empower these communities through education and language.”His tireless efforts haven’t gone unnoticed. Inspired by his success, Tripura’s friend, Ramsung Bom has opened a similar school in Kunchingpara, serving the Khumi tribe. “I felt so proud when I found out that I had inspired others,” said Tripura.As the morning sun cast a warm glow over the hills, Tripura excused himself from the conversation. He took a weathered bell and rang it out loud, its clear tone echoing through the village.“Within 10 minutes, school will start,” he said.My friends were roused from their slumber. Some wandered curiously towards the schoolhouse, while others, myself included, felt the need to leave for our planned trek. Yet, we lingered.As if on cue, a gaggle of children, with eager faces, began to trickle in. A hum of activity filled the air as the small school transformed into a hub of learning.The rhythmic sounds of Bangla alphabets rose. “Au”, they chanted, voices blending in harmony. “Aa”, the sound echoed through the hills.Faisal Mahmud is a journalist based in Dhaka.February 21 is observed as the International Mother Language Day.

The Citizenship Act has for the first time introduced a religious criterion to Indian citizenship by allowing undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh to apply for Indian citizenship.On Sunday, Banerjee stated she had information that at least 50 Aadhaar cards had been deactivated in Bardhaman, reported The Economic Times. “Similar things are happening in Birbhum, North 24 Parganas, Burdwan and several other districts,” alleged the Trinamool Congress chief.She described the deactivations a “conspiracy of the Centre to enforce the National Register of Citizens and the Citizenship Amendment Act”, according to The Statesman.“So many people are in distress, living in fear and uncertainty about how they will get the government benefits,” said Banerjee. “Bank accounts are also linked with Aadhaar, which means once the card is disabled the bank account also becomes inoperative. This is done deliberately to cause problems before the Lok Sabha polls.”The chief minister reiterated the claims during a press conference on Monday and said that most of those whose cards have been deactivated are all from the Matua community or belong to the Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe communities, reported The Indian Express.Matuas are a sect comprising Dalits who mostly migrated from Bangladesh to West Bengal. Although they are only a small segment of the total number of refugees in the state, Matuas are often treated as a bellwether given their extremely organised order and consistent lobbying efforts for refugee rights.“What is their [Centre’s] game plan and intention behind this?” Banerjee questioned. “The Aadhaar cards of Matuas and SC/ST [Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes] communities are being deactivated and the state government or district administrations were not informed.”Banerjee also asserted that she would neither allow the National Register of Citizens in West Bengal nor would she let detention camps get set up.The chief minister on Monday also wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, stating that the deactivation of Aadhaar cards has created chaos and led to “hue and cry” among West Bengal’s residents.“I would like to know from you about the causes for such sudden action of deactivation of Aadhaar cards without assigning reasons,” she wrote. “Is it just for the sake of depriving the eligible beneficiaries of the benefit or to create a panic situation among the people at large just before the ensuing Lok Sabha Elections?”She added: “I am really shocked to see such an action of deactivation of Aadhaar Cards in the state against the interest of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes and the poor section of the society.”On Monday, Union minister Shantanu Thakur said at a press conference that the Aadhaar cards were deactivated due to a “technical error”. He also clarified that all such cards would be reactivated soon.“The Union home minister has clarified that the process of deactivation has been stopped,” Thakur, a Lok Sabha MP from West Bengal, said. “I have been given the responsibility to take applications from all those whose cards were deactivated. People would be able to submit their applications via WhatsApp or email.”The Unique Identification Authority of India, which manages the Centre’s Aadhaar system, said on Monday that no number had been cancelled, reported PTI.“In the course of activities undertaken to keep the Aadhaar database updated, intimations are issued from time to time to Aadhaar number holders,” said the authority. “In case any Aadhaar number holder has any grievance in this regard, they may submit their feedback to UIDAI at this link https://uidai.gov.in/en/contact-support/feedback.html Any such grievance will be duly addressed.”",The Centre has said that the deactivations occurred due to a ‘technical error’ and they would be reactivated soon.,None,None,None,Scroll Staff,bangladesh,2024-02-20 13:28:00,2024-02-20 13:58:00
https://scroll.in/reel/1063606/love-storiyaan-review-a-brave-reminder-that-the-heart-works-in-mysterious-ways,‘Love Storiyaan’ review: A brave reminder that the heart works in mysterious ways,"In the Prime Video show Love Storiyaan, many things are said about the adamantine ways of the heart. Two of the most succinct declarations come from women.Aekta, a Punjabi married to Ullekh from Kerala: there is a knowing from within that this is the path, whatever the obstacles.Farida, about her college sweetheart Sunit, whom she eventually married: what does his faith matter? He is a boy after all.If only it was so simple. Love Storiyaan rows its boat in the choppy sea of relationships entered into by consenting adults and judged by everyone else. The docuseries profiles couples who have braved social obstacles to get married. Religion, caste, regional differences, gender identity – courageous are the men and women who ignore these deep fault lines in pursuit of life-long companionship, and brave is the show that spotlights their experiences.The Dharmatic Entertainment production is based on stories featured on the Instagram account India Love Project set up by the journalists Priya Ramani, Samar Halarnkar and Niloufer Venkatraman. The episodes, conceptualised by Somen Mishra, have been made by millennial directors most directly affected by the prevailing discourse against diverse marriages, especially the criminalisation of Hindu-Muslim unions.Love Storiyaan follows a uniform style across its six episodes. We meet the couples in the present and revisit their past through dramatised recreations. This device, meant to make the documentary format more accessible, creates an affected, artificial tone, as though we were in a corny movie. More compelling is when the subjects speak about what made them romantic rebels.Shazia Iqbal, who made the wonderful short film Bebaak in 2019, helms Love Storiyaan’s most fulfilling and memorable story. Iqbal’s episode, written with Rahul Badwelkar and elegantly edited by Jabeen Merchant, is also the most documentary-like in the series.Sunit and Farida (who also goes by the name Sharmila) are the kind of lovey-dovey elderly pair about whom movies are made. They met as college students in Bangladesh. They moved to Kolkata in 1976, sacrificing personal ties and much else to be together.Farida’s occasional lapses into Bengali are a relief from the spoken Hindi that prevails across the show. Love Storiyaan features characters along the linguistic spectrum but has them speak in Hindi, perhaps to be more accessible.The agenda of appealing to as broad a subscriber base as possible is clearly paramount, resulting in frothy narratives that evaporate soon after the back stories have been revealed. There’s a lack of rigour in the episodes by Hardik Mehta (featuring Ullekh and Aekta), Vivek Soni (about Nicholas and Rajani, an inter-faith radio jockey couple), Archana Phadke (Dhanya from Kerala endures war and separation from her Afghani spouse Homayon) and Collin D’Cunha (transwoman Tista weds transman Dipan). These are lightweight, workmanlike examinations of deep life experiences, which give a fleeting sense of the agonies endured and overcome. The stakes are slightly raised in the episode by Akshay Indikar, co-written with Tejashri Akshay. Indikar meets Rahul Banerjee and Subhadra Khaperde, activists who work among Adivasis in central India. Memories of the inter-caste union – he is a Brahmin and she is a Dalit – are laid out against the perils visited upon human rights advocates.Like the other women in the show, Subhadra is frank and funny even as she tosses off the casteism she has encountered. The episode has no sustained rhythm, laying out scene after scene of the couple speaking to the camera, but the story is engrossing in itself.Love Storiyaan mostly soft-pedals the real-world consequences of the demonisation of unorthodox marriages, opting for affirming conversations, mawkish background music and wistful imagery. “Everything works out in the end” is the sentiment that prevails, as though to encourage viewers who might be in similar situations.Farida, who churns out some of the best statements, speaks for everyone else when she observes that she doesn’t care for what other people thought of Sunit – the reaction is their problem.Despite its feebleness, Love Storiyaan earns brownie points simply by existing. In the bargain, we meet people who have lived to tell the tale – proof that while the toxic campaign against taboo passion is hard at work, the heart continues to work in mysterious ways.",The Prime Video series profiles six couples who have rebelled against social strictures against their marriages.,None,None,None,Nandini Ramnath,bangladesh,2024-02-14 08:45:00,2024-02-14 09:15:00

The system aims to keep local populations shielded from large-scale migration.In June 2022, the Manipur Cabinet adopted 1961 as the base year for determining who could be given native status under the Inner Line Permit system.""We are passing through troubled times,” the Manipur chief minister said at an event on Monday, reported PTI. “The crisis we are facing today is one of struggle for existence, survival, and identity. The properties and identity, inherited over centuries, have now become insecure due to the lack of vision of certain politicians.”Singh said that the current generation is insecure and hence the government was working to make their futures secure.The chief minister, who belongs to the majority Meitei community, and the Central government have on multiple occasions held migrants from neighbouring Myanmar responsible for ethnic violence in the state that began last year.Manipur has been gripped by ethnic clashes between the Meitei and Kuki communities since early May. Over 200 people have been killed since the conflict broke out and nearly 67,000 persons have been forced to flee their homes.The Inner Line Permit system was re-introduced in Manipur in December 2019 amid protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.The Act provides citizenship to refugees from six minority religious communities from Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on the condition that they have lived in India for six years and entered the country by December 31, 2014.In the North East, the law led to renewed anxieties that a large number of Bengali-speaking migrants from Bangladesh may overwhelm communities defined as indigenous to the region.To address these concerns, the Centre had introduced geographical exemptions in the Citizenship Amendment Bill for tribal-dominated Sixth Schedule and Inner Line Permit areas. It also extended the Inner Line Permit regime to the state of Manipur and Dimapur in Nagaland overnight.Last week, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs also recommended the immediate suspension of India’s free movement regime with Myanmar.The free movement regime, which has been in place since the 1970s, allows visa-free movement for people living within 16 kms on either side of India and Myanmar’s shared, largely unfenced, 1,643-km-long border along Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.","In June 2022, the state Cabinet decided to adopt 1961 as the base year for determining native status under the Inner Line Permit system.",None,None,None,Scroll Staff,bangladesh,2024-02-13 17:19:00,2024-02-13 17:49:00
https://scroll.in/article/1063469/is-police-investigation-into-mira-road-riots-biased-against-muslims,Why the police investigation into Mira Road violence has left Muslims with little hope of justice,"On the night of January 21, Sunaina Gupta was riding pillion with her husband Vinod Jaiswal on a motor bike. Her children, she said, were holding saffron flags with the words “Jai Shri Ram” written on them and travelling in a car.They were in a motorcade of “around 10 bikes and six cars”, Gupta said, all celebrating the Ram temple inauguration in Ayodhya the next morning, when they entered Naya Nagar, a Muslim quarter in Mira Road, an area north of Mumbai.Gupta said they were attacked by a crowd with stones, pipes and sticks. She was left with a wound on her head and required three stitches near her eyebrow.By the next day, the police had registered a first information report. Among the sections of the Indian Penal Code invoked was the one that relates to “attempt to murder”. The police have so far arrested 21 people, including two minors, from the Muslim community. The punishment under this section, a non-bailable offence, is life imprisonment.Three hours after the Naya Nagar clash, and about 3 km away, a mob stopped Jabir Siraj Ansari while he was driving a couple from Andheri to Bhayandar in his cab.The mob demanded to see his identity card, his uncle told Scroll. When they saw he was Muslim, the mob allowed his passengers to leave and then attacked Ansari with wooden sticks and stones.He sustained multiple fractures on his face and nose, and had to be operated on.But when the local police registered a first information report, the sections invoked were those that involved “causing hurt by dangerous weapon”, a bailable offence. The punishment for such a crime is three years or a fine or both. No arrests have been made in the case.Muslim residents of Mira Road and Bhayander, neighbourhoods to the north of Mumbai that were engulfed in communal clashes in the run-up to the Ram temple consecration and after, allege that the contrasting approaches of the police in Gupta’s and Ansari’s cases reveals a clear bias.They say that while the police have invoked stringent sections of the law and made arrests in cases where Muslims are accused of violence, they have invoked milder sections in cases where Hindutva mobs attacked and assaulted Muslims.At least 22 shops owned by Muslims were vandalised during the clashes – so far the police have not registered an FIR in a single case, advocate Shahood Anwar, who is representing the shop owners, told Scroll.Scroll analysed eight FIRs registered in the communal violence, that began on January 21 and ended by January 23, and found a similar pattern. Of them, in four FIRs where the complainant is a Muslim, no arrests have been made.Mira Bhayandar police commissioner Madhukar Pandey did not respond to numerous calls and messages asking for his comments on the police action.FIR number: 0022 Thirty-four-year-old Jabir Siraj Ansari, who works with the cab aggregator Ola, bought a car two months ago. On the night of January 21, he was driving a man and a woman from Andheri to Bhayandar. Around 2 am, according to his statement in the first information report, he saw a group of men, some of whom had parked their bikes on roads, stopping vehicles and checking ID cards near Maxus mall in Bhayandar west. His uncle Rafiq Ansari told Scroll that at least four vehicles were allowed to leave but his car was stopped because he was a Muslim. The FIR states that the passengers, both Hindus, were allowed to go. Ansari was beaten up using wooden sticks. The windows of his car were smashed and he sustained severe wounds on face. “He believes they wanted to kill him. They hit him multiple times on the head,” Rafiq said. Ansari claims he survived because two police officers patrolling the area approached them, forcing the mob to flee. The police took him to Mira hospital. “We have spent over Rs 1 lakh on his nose surgery and treatment so far,” Rafiq said. Ansari’s medical reports, which Scroll has seen, show that the assault left him with a nasal bone fracture, a fracture in the lateral wall of the sinus, fracture in the region of cheekbone, and soft tissue edema, a swelling caused when fluid collects in tissues. Since the assault, Ansari has not returned to work. “He has three young children and will not be able to work for several more weeks,” Rafiq said. The Bhayandar police registered a case under sections of the IPC that deal with causing hurt by dangerous weapons, causing damage, and crime committed by one or more persons with common intention. Ansari’s advocate Shahood Anwar said despite the serious nature of his client’s injury, the police invoked milder charges against the accused. “That is not the case when the complainant is Hindu,” he said. Ansari said they tried to add Section 307, which deals with an attempt to murder, in the FIR but police was “not willing”.Ansari’s uncle pointed to the police’s promptness “in arresting those responsible in the Naya Nagar clash”, which took place three hours ago. In that case, he said, Section 307 was added. “There is CCTV footage in my nephew’s case,” Rafiq said. But no arrests have been made. He added that they have visited the police station several times. “Every time the police say we are investigating. How can they take so long?” FIR number: 0034 Three hours before Ansari was attacked, Sunaina Gupta, a resident of Bhayandar, went for a drive with her family and friends. While the local Bharatiya Janata Party legislator Geeta Jain told Scroll no procession was organised in Naya Nagar on the night of January 21, Gupta confirmed that at least six cars and over 10 motorbikes were part of the procession, with several of them waving saffron flags and chanting “Jai Shri Ram”. Gupta said as they got stuck in traffic in Naya Nagar, they took a turn and ended up in a lane with a dead end. A junior college and mosque was near the spot they stopped. Gupta said they were trying to find a place to click a group picture. “Suddenly a group of men began to abuse and attack us,” she said. “They raised the slogan of ‘Allah-u-akbar.’” Muslim residents, however, claimed that the group in the car began to chant “Jai Shri Ram” with an intention to provoke. Gupta said she kept her distance from the men, but later she and her husband tried to rescue another man being assaulted. “That is when I was attacked on the head. My son said they hit me with a pipe. It started bleeding,” she said. Her sister Archana Gupta suffered a shoulder injury. “Those in the mob pulled her hand,” she said. Their children too suffered minor injuries. The next afternoon, her husband, a businessman, filed a complaint with Naya Nagar police.In his statement, he said there were three cars and 10 bikes, and they were forcefully stopped and attacked by a group of 50-60 men. The police registered a case under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code that relate to attempt to murder, wrongful restraint, punishment for deliberate acts intended to outrage religious feelings, promoting enmity between two religions, using criminal force for illegal activity, unlawful assembly and rioting, among others. Senior police inspector Vilas Supe told Scroll that 21 adults have been arrested so far in this case, and two minors are accused. “More arrests are expected to follow as we continue the investigation,” he said. FIR number: 0040A day after the Ram temple opening, Hindutva groups ran amok on Mira Road, smashing shop displays and hitting Muslims.In Shanti Nagar, a mob attacked 22-year-old Mohammad Tariq Chaudhary while he was driving a tempo. The words “Rashid Tempo Service” were written on the vehicle. Several videos of the attack went viral. Tariq suffered injuries on his hands, chest, back and face. Two men who were with him, Matiullah Shah, 21, and Deen Ali Shaikh, 45, were also attacked.Shah received three stitches on head. Only Shaikh escaped with minor injuries.The mob chanted “Jai Shri Ram” and used sticks, stones, chains to beat the trio, Tariq said.The Naya Nagar police registered a case the next day under sections that related to rioting, unlawful assembly, and voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons, and wrongful restraint.Tariq’s father Abdul Chaudhary said they repeatedly asked the police to add Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC but they refused.Tariq told Scroll that the police have not shown any interest in their case. “So my friends and I began to identify the assaulters,” he said.He said his friends found an Instagram handle that live-streamed the attacks on January 23. They also traced the first names of three of his attackers whose faces were captured in the video.The police have made no arrests.Supe, senior police officer at Naya Nagar, told Scroll that they have asked Tariq to provide the full name and address of the accused for them to investigate further. “How is that possible for me to find?” Tariq asked.Shah, who received three stitches, said he has given up hope of a fair investigation.FIR number: 0024 On January 22, Ashfaq Ali Akbar Ali Shaikh was riding his two-wheeler from Kandivali to Bhayandar when a mob stopped him on the Mira Road overbridge.“My Activa has a sticker saying ‘Khwaja Garib Nawaz’,” the 33-year-old said. “That’s how they identified my religion.”In his statement to police and in conversation with Scroll, Shaikh said that the men who stopped him asked him to say “Jai Shri Ram”. When he refused, they began to hit his head with sticks.“They hit my head thrice,” he said. “I was wearing a helmet, otherwise I would have sustained a major injury.”His attackers were mostly young men. None of them were hiding their faces, he added.The mob broke the front body of his two-wheeler using iron rods. They hit him on his hand and chest, his statement said. “Two people came to my rescue and tried to reason with the mob,” he said. That is when they let him leave.Shaikh said he stayed home for two days out of fear. “I was home except for the time I went to the police station to file a complaint,” he said.The Bhayandar police registered a case under sections that deal with communal violence, promoting enmity between groups, rioting and criminal intimidation (Section 503 of the IPC) and punishment for causing hurt (Section 323).Both Sections 503 and 323 are mild charges that can result in 1-2 years of imprisonment. Both are bailable offences. Again, no arrests have been made in the case.FIR number: 0023 On January 22, Murtuza Jawrawala was riding a bike with his brother Khozema, on their way to their cousin’s shop, when they saw a mob of men riding on bikes and chanting “Jai Shri Ram” outside the Mira Bhayandar municipal corporation.He stopped by the road side to allow them to pass. “They looked angry,” the 35-year-old said.The bikers, however, stopped when they spotted them. “I was wearing a skull cap and I have a long beard,” he told Scroll, indicating how the Hindu men identified him as a Muslim.“Some of their faces were masked with cloth. But I could see most of their faces, they were teenagers,” he said.The mob first broke the mudguard of the bike, and then hit Jawrawala’s hand.“A police van came from behind minutes later and the bikers left,” he said. Jawrawala filed a complaint with the Bhayandar police station. An offence was registered with charges of unlawful assembly and rioting, and other milder sections such as provocation to a person, punishment for causing hurt, wrongful restraint, and causing damage. All are bailable offences and no arrests have been made.The same day, the Naya Nagar police registered a separate omnibus case (FIR number 0036) against unknown people for rioting, stone-pelting and unlawful assembly.Senior inspector Supe told Scroll that over 150 people were involved, but none have been arrested so far. “We are looking at CCTV footage and investigation is on,” he said.FIR numbers: 0035 and 0037The police also cracked down on provocative speech by Muslims with swiftness – but offensive speech and violence by Hindus have not led to similar action.For example, the Naya Nagar police arrested Abu Shema Shaikh, a garment vendor, from his home in Naya Nagar after a video he posted went viral on social media. “It is this post that led to anger amongst Hindus,” said Vishwa Hindu Parishad district head Nagnath Kamble.In the post, Shaikh refers to the communal clash in Naya Nagar on January 21 and warns Hindus of consequences if they hold rallies in Muslim neighbourhoods and chant “Jai Shri Ram”.Shaikh was charged under sections that are used in cases of promoting hatred between two groups and Section 66c of IT Act. According to police, his provocative post encouraged Muslims to act violently.Activist Azeemuddin Sayed, who is a resident of Mira Road, pointed out that no action was taken against BJP leader Nitesh Rane whose provocative speech in a press conference and, later, at a rally was followed by riots on January 23 in Mira Road.Rane called the Muslims of Naya Nagar “jihadi”, a derogatory term used by Hindutva groups, and said illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar live in Naya Nagar. He also called for bulldozers to raze their property.Similarly, Mira Bhayander MLA Geeta Jain also told the media that five minutes is enough for a huge number of Hindus to show their might. No complaint has been filed against the legislator or Rane.On January 23, the Naya Nagar police arrested 19-year-old Danish Khan following a social media video post. In the video, he is heard saying, “Jung chhid hi gayi hai to talvaaro ko dhar kara lo, kyon ki khatam bhi hum hi karenge.” If war has started, sharpen your swords, because we will finish this war.An official from Naya Nagar police said Khan’s post went viral and instigated the Muslim community against Hindus. He was charged under Sections 153A and 505-2, both relating to creating enmity between religious groups or classes.Khan remained in police custody for 10 days before he was granted bail. In the bail order, a single judge bench in Thane court observed that there was no evidence to link him with the riots.",A Scroll analysis of FIRs found arrests and stringent charges in cases where Muslims are accused. Hindus accused of violence face charges that are far milder.,None,None,None,Tabassum Barnagarwala,bangladesh,2024-02-13 06:30:00,2024-02-13 07:00:00

Ravi, the governor, declined to read the customary address delivered to the House on the first day of the session every year, saying that it contained numerous passages with which he disagreed on “factual and moral grounds”.Tamil Nadu Speaker M Appavu then read out the address before the House.“We stand with minorities and our Sri Lankan Tamil brethren, as we pledge to protect their rights,” the address stated. “This government will never permit the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act in our state and vows to take all necessary measures in this regard.""The government said that while the ideal of unity in diversity faces a grave threat in the country, the state administration is committed to ensuring communal harmony.The Citizenship Amendment Act, approved by Parliament in December 2019, is aimed to provide citizenship to refugees from six minority religious communities, except Muslims, from Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on the condition that they have lived in India for six years and had entered the country by December 31, 2014.The Act has been widely criticised for excluding Muslims, sparking massive protests across the country. Indian Muslims fear that the law could be used, along with the nationwide National Register of Citizens, to harass and disenfranchise them. The National Register of Citizens is a proposed exercise to identify undocumented immigrants.While the legislation received the president’s assent in late 2019, the rules of the citizenship law are yet to be published. This is despite parliamentary guidelines stating that the rules must be published within six months of an Act coming into force.The Tamil Nadu government had in September 2021 passed a resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act, with Chief Minister MK Stalin stating that the law was discriminatory as it had no provisions for Sri Lankan Tamil refugees to get Indian citizenship.On January 31, Stalin reiterated his government’s stand on the controversial Act. “I give an assurance that we will not let Citizenship Amendment Act set foot in Tamil Nadu,” the chief minister was quoted as saying by Deccan Herald.Ten days later, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said that the Act would be implemented before the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.The home ministry has sought extensions at least eight times to frame the rules since the law was enacted.

Look around you,” he said, pointing out the  modern multistorey houses that have sprung up in the village in Haryana  state thanks to remittances sent from migrants already overseas.He is among a growing number of young Indians – mostly men from the  northern states of Punjab and Haryana and Gujarat in the west – migrating illegally to countries including the United States, Canada and Britain in search of better-paid jobs.A record 96,917 Indians were caught or expelled  last year trying to cross into the United States, up from 30,662 in  2021, according to US Customs and Border Protection. It is not clear  how many more managed to cross the border.Aware of the risk of failure, Bhanwala declined to share details of his journey plan – fearing it could jinx his travels.Instead, he showed off a new pair of hiking boots, a puffer jacket  and a big blue rucksack purchased for the trip, and recounted his  reasons for deciding to go.“I’ve been unemployed for six months ... There’s nothing here for  me,” Bhanwala, a political science graduate, told Context at his home in  Dhatrath, which lies some 150 km from the capital, New  Delhi.Bhanwala wanted to be a policeman, but gave up after question papers  for a recruitment exam in 2021 were leaked to other candidates – dampening his hopes of success. “I lost all faith in the recruitment process, and thought ‘enough is  enough’,” said Bhanwala, whose father sold the family’s farmland and  borrowed money from a loan shark to pay a people smuggler Rs 50 lakh ($60,175) for the trip.In interviews with 32 people in seven Haryana villages, most cited  unemployment and a lack of skilled, well-paid jobs as the motive driving  hundreds of men to leave via the “donkey” route – a long, roundabout  journey designed to dodge border controls.India’s unemployment rate has been steadily falling since 2018, but  rural joblessness remains a problem – especially among the young. Both  joblessness and underemployment are a key concern for authorities ahead  of a general election due by May.The number of Indians betting it all to migrate to wealthy countries  is as much about aspiration as fleeing poverty, migration experts say.“People are trying to find better job prospects wherever they get  them ... even if that means doing low-end jobs abroad ... just for  better pay,” said Rahul Verma, a fellow at New Delhi-based Centre for  Policy Research.The Union labour ministry did not respond to requests for comment.The “donkey” route has been an open secret in Punjab for more than a decade. The term originates from the Punjabi word “dunki”, meaning to “hop  from place to place”, and is also depicted in the eponymous Hindi film  starring Bollywood icon Shah Rukh Khan.The “donkey” practice made international headlines in December when France grounded a charter flight,  which was carrying 303 Indian passengers from Dubai to Nicaragua, on  suspicions of people smuggling. Most were sent back to India.      People traffickers often take migrants from New Delhi and Mumbai to the United Arab Emirates on tourist visas.Then they go through as many as a dozen transit points in Latin  America such as Venezuela, Nicaragua and Guatemala to reach the  US-Mexico border, according to families of men who had recently  completed their “donkey” journeys.Once at the border, handlers supply them with fake backstories – in  case they get caught while crossing – to make asylum claims on grounds  ranging from economic hardship to persecution over religious or LGBTQ+  identity.A spokesperson for US Customs and Border Protection said the  overall number of would-be immigrants being caught or denied entry  continues to fluctuate “as smugglers and bad actors continue to spread  falsehoods and show complete disregard for the safety and wellbeing of  vulnerable migrants”.Such immigration is also known as the “number two” route, the “number  one” being the legal way, which villagers and migrant rights  campaigners said was nearly impossible to pursue due to visa rejections  or backlogs.US visa services are still attempting to clear a backlog after  Washington halted almost all visa processing worldwide in March 2020 due  to the Covid-19 pandemic. Indian applicants for visas – including those pursuing tech jobs  in the United States – have seen wait times for an appointment of over a  year in some cases, though delays fell sharply in 2023 when a record 1.4 million visas were processed, according to the US Embassy and Consulates in India. But the visa backlogs seen in recent years may have spurred some would-be migrants to take the “donkey” route instead.“We’re leaving these people with no other ways of trying to pursue  economic prosperity or safety, in a sense,” said Mario Montoya of  Aliento, a Phoenix-based immigrant advocacy group.For would-be migrants, the decision carries a hefty price tag, and huge risks.Some villagers said they had spent most – if not all – of their  family savings or up to Rs 85 lakh to pay for the journey,  knowing they could face harsh weather, hunger, disease, abuse and  sometimes even death.  An Indian family, including a 3-year-old, froze to death near the US-Canada border in January 2022.But most said the potential rewards compensated for the risks.Families said their sons and nephews sent at least Rs 2 lakh home every month, mainly doing a mix of full- and part-time jobs at gas  stations, malls, grocery stores and restaurants.   “He makes about $100 a day at a dairy farm in California. He made  Rs 6,000 ($72) in a month doing the same job here,” said Suresh  Kumar, 45, referring to his nephew who left in November 2022 and reached  the United States in April 2023.    Relatives said the money not only helped them clear debts and pay for  things like school tuition, dowries, home renovations and new cars, but  also boosted their social status.It is easy to identify households with a relative in the United  States in Haryana  – besides the glossy posters depicting the US flag,  the Statue of Liberty and the US national bird – the bald eagle, cars  and motorbikes sport red, white and blue “America” stickers.Locals in the village of Ahar call it “Mini America”.But the success stories of a handful of “donkey” migrants misleads  the majority, warned S Irudaya Rajan, chairman of the International  Institute of Migration and Development in southern Kerala state. “Everybody keeps talking about the benefits of migration, but nobody  talks about the problems and challenges ... We have to tell the full  story,” said Rajan.Across Haryana, stories abound about failed attempts to reach the  United States, where illegal migration has been a major issue in the  run-up to this year’s presidential election.Goru Khenchi, 22, said he and 10 other migrants, including several  from Nepal and Bangladesh, were stuck in Italy for six months after  their handler abandoned them. They were eventually caught and deported  back to India in early 2023.For those that reach their destination, a raft of challenges await – from language barriers to problems finding work, housing and accessing  healthcare, said Rajan.Loneliness and mental health problems such as depression are also common among new arrivals.When Chris, who asked to go by his newly adopted American nickname,  reached New Jersey in August 2023 after an arduous six-month “donkey”  journey that involved sleeping in safe house toilets and surviving on  water and biscuits, he said it felt surreal.Big roads, clean air, huge portions of food – just like what he had seen in Hollywood movies.“But that soon ended. I couldn’t understand or speak English properly  ... Everything became a struggle. I started missing home, my family, my  friends,” he said on a WhatsApp call.“It’s very lonely here,” said Chris, who shared a photo of his  accommodation – the basement of the grocery store where he works,  equipped with a single mattress, small TV and a few provisions.The possibility of permanent residence and eventually citizenship  keep him motivated, he said. Almost all the relatives back home said  that was the ultimate goal. Many said they wanted President Joe Biden to win a second term in  November’s election, perceiving the Democrat as more welcoming of  undocumented migrants than his likely rival, Donald Trump.Biden’s administration is grappling with record migration flows  that have pushed US border controls to the limit, though the US.Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said immigration law is being  enforced.“Our borders are not open for those without a legal basis to enter the country,” the spokesperson said.Migration experts say the US lacks the capacity to detain and  process migrants at the border due to understaffed patrols and shortages  of asylum officers and immigration judges – an opportunity that people  smugglers have been quick to seize.“Right now, under the system, we should be detaining millions of  people at the border - we just don’t have (the) capacity to do it,” said  Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, a  US-based think-tank.“And migrants, or their smugglers, know it too well,” he said. At the same time, the current tight US labour market has stoked  demand for undocumented workers  – providing an added incentive to those  contemplating the journey, but increasing the risk of exploitation among  illegal immigrants.“The question becomes – is there a way to make it safer for these  migrants?” said Ina Ganguly, an economics professor at the University  of Massachusetts Amherst, pointing to other major sources of migrant  labour such as the Philippines where the government promotes economic migration and seeks to protect workers’ rights abroad. The External Affairs Ministry did not respond to requests for comment. But  in parliamentary proceedings in December, it said it had identified  nearly 3,000 suspected people smugglers.It also said there were “continuous efforts to raise awareness on  safe and legal migration” via a series of initiatives including a  pre-departure workshop for migrants to help build their soft skills, and  educate them on their rights and support services.Migration, public policy and economic experts, however, said it was  difficult to stop such movement completely as it was usually voluntary.“The ultimate solution would be for India to start growing at a much  higher pace, and create more and well-paying job prospects,” said Verma  of CPR.    At home in Dhatrath, Bhanwala spends his last days at home  exercising, watching YouTube vlogs by young Indians who have documented  their successful “donkey” journeys, and practicing his English on a  language-learning app.“I need to be mentally and physically strong. My family is depending on me to change our fortunes,” he said.“If I get sent back, everything will be gone.”        This article first appeared on Context, powered by the Thomson Reuters Foundation.Also read: Surging Indian illegal immigration to the US belies the ‘superpower’ narrative","Aspiration and poverty are driving many to stake their life’s savings in the hope of making a better life, even if it means doing odd-jobs in the US.

https://scroll.in/latest/1063512/caa-will-be-implemented-before-lok-sabha-elections-says-amit-shah,"CAA will be implemented before Lok Sabha elections, says Amit Shah","The Citizenship Amendment Act will be implemented before the Lok Sabha elections, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Saturday.“The Citizenship Amendment Act was the Congress government’s promise,” Shah said at the 2024 ET Now Global Business Summit. “When the country was divided and the minorities were persecuted in that country [referring to Pakistan], Congress had assured the refugees that they were welcome in India and that they would be provided with Indian citizenship. However, they backed away later.”The home minister said that he wanted to emphasise that the Act is not meant to “take away anyone’s citizenship”. “Minorities in our country, and especially our Muslim brothers, are being provoked,” Shah said.The Citizenship Amendment Act, approved by Parliament in December 2019, is aimed to provide citizenship to refugees from six minority religious communities, except Muslims, from Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on the condition that they have lived in India for six years and had entered the country by December 31, 2014.The Act has been widely criticised for excluding Muslims, sparking massive protests across the country. Indian Muslims fear that the law could be used, along with the nationwide National Register of Citizens, to harass and disenfranchise them. The National Register of Citizens is a proposed exercise to identify undocumented immigrants.While the legislation received the president’s assent in late 2019, the rules of the citizenship law are yet to be published. This is despite parliamentary guidelines stating that the rules must be published within six months of an Act coming into force.The Union home ministry has sought extensions at least eight times to frame the rules since the law was enacted. It had initially cited the Covid-19 pandemic as the reason for the delay and subsequently said that framing the rules needed more consultation.On Saturday, Shah also said that the Uniform Civil Code, which has been on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s agenda for several decades, is also on constitutional agenda.“The constitution framers had said in Article 44 that UCC should be implemented when the time is right,” he said at the event. “Jawaharlal Nehru had signed it… but Congress ignored it due to appeasement politics, and the Bharatiya Janata Party held on to UCC religiously.”The Uniform Civil Code is a common set of laws governing marriage, divorce, succession and adoption for people of all communities. Currently, such personal affairs of different religious and tribal groups are based on community-specific laws, largely derived from religious scripture.In recent months, several states ruled by the BJP have taken steps towards the code’s implementation within their jurisdiction.On Wednesday, Uttarakhand became the first Indian state to adopt such a code after independence. A common civil code has been in place in Goa since the Portuguese Civil Code was adopted there in 1867.Shah said that the government first implemented it in Uttarakhand because it is “an issue of big social transformation”.“There should be social debate and debate among religious groups and it will be subjected to legal scrutiny,” he said. “After the outcome of such debates, all states will adopt it.”He said that there cannot be laws based on religion in a secular country. “The entire world has accepted this, and our view is the same,” he said.",Shah also alleged that the Congress had ignored the Uniform Civil Code because of its ‘appeasement politics’.,None,None,None,Scroll Staff,bangladesh,2024-02-10 18:04:00,2024-02-10 18:34:00
https://scroll.in/article/1062859/interconnected-issues-voices-from-the-margins-the-indo-pacific-needs-an-inclusive-climate-policy,"Interconnected issues, voices from the margins: The Indo-Pacific needs an inclusive climate policy ","Amidst geopolitical flux and increasing tensions, the Indo-Pacific remains one of the world’s most important economic and geopolitical regions. This shared space comprises 40 economies, 65% of the world’s population (around 4.3 billion people) and $47.19 trillion in economic activity. The threat from climate change looms large in the region, endangering millions of lives and potentially having a significant impact on global economic growth. Recognising its strategic importance and these potential vulnerabilities, many of the world’s major geopolitical players – whether situated in the region or beyond – have drawn out security blueprints and policy programs focused on the Indo-Pacific over the past decade. A number of these actors, including Germany, the United States, Canada, France, South Korea, and Bangladesh, have incorporated climate security and its various dimensions into their strategies. But efforts to engage with the climate challenge within a geopolitical framework will remain lacking if the diverse needs of the Indo-Pacific’s people are not included. Our research at Kubernein Initiative has focused on the human impact of the interconnectedness of climate change (in terms of weather patterns and more frequent and intense natural hazards), with urban development as well as more “traditional” security concerns, faced by the people in the Indo-Pacific. The Indian Ocean region is referred to as the “World Hazard Belt”, where earthquakes and tsunamis occur   frequently. Challenges include, but are not limited to, rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and the intensified occurrences of typhoons, cyclones, floods, droughts, heatwaves, and other natural disasters. By 2050, over  80% of the population in the Indo-Pacific could be directly impacted by climate change, a 15% increase since 2000.Climate change as a “threat multiplier” is a term now widely used to describe the cascading effects onto several overlapping areas: migration of people, resource scarcity, growing urban population, human health and well-being, livelihoods and economic security, agricultural productivity and related livelihoods. For example: the Indo-Pacific produces  over 50% of the total global captured fish – more than any other region. However, ocean warming, changing levels of salinity, and sea level rise affect the presence and availability of fish and aquatic life, thereby impacting the livelihoods of fishing-dependent communities and increasing the incidence of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated fishing. A decline in fishing activity in the region could have major downstream impacts on women and marginalised groups that are typically economically dependent on fishing. For instance, in Asia women comprise  around 72% of the aquaculture industry, whose livelihoods are threatened, thereby hampering their economic security and ability to contribute to the growth of the aquaculture industry. In recognising the transnational nature of climate change, it becomes evident that the imperative for climate action extends beyond any single state, necessitating, instead, a concerted and collaborative approach that encompasses not only individual states but also regional organisations and governments. Regional “minilateral” groupings are proving to be effective, including incorporating ideas of inclusivity – referring to the inclusion of a wider gamut of stakeholders to foster more equitable outcomes – into traditional strategic efforts. For example,  attempts to ensure considerations of gender and equality form a part of all policies including security and external affairs are  gaining traction through provisions like ASEAN’s Gender Mainstreaming Framework.As it becomes clear that climate change holds a central position in the Indo-Pacific strategies of various states and regional organisations, there is a substantial gap in understanding where the risks lie and whom they affect, leading to setbacks in advancing cooperation on climate security. Differences exist among industrialised, developing, and least-developed nations in the region regarding matters like climate finance, loss and damage, and emissions reduction targets, leading to a lack of consensus on priority areas. While human security issues are given precedence, these disparities persist. For example, despite the growing use of military capabilities for Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief operations in the region, concerns related to military security and competing geopolitical interests  take precedence over those associated with climate security. Tensions between China and the West to gain influence in the Pacific have provided an opening to discuss climate action, but this so far is motivated more by securing geopolitical interests. The ramifications of climate change remain inadequately defined, and when strategies are evaluated on the criterion of inclusivity, have a long way to go. The current lack of inclusivity in climate action is visible in two major ways. The first involves overlooking the disproportionate and differentiated impact of climate change on women and vulnerable groups. Vulnerabilities span socio-economic status and geographic location, creating a mosaic of challenges across the region. Small island developing states in the Pacific face existential threats from rising sea levels, while communities in Southeast Asia contend with the increasing frequency of severe storms. The Pacific Islands or Bangladesh are responsible for a mere  0.03% and 0.4% of global greenhouse gas emissions respectively, but face repercussions disproportionately with numerous cascading effects. Fiji, for example, has planned a relocation for  42 villages due to a rise in sea levels and soil that is unfit for agriculture because of high salt content. Bangladesh is facing a future of  at least one super cyclone every year in the coming decades. The second involves marginalised voices not being represented in climate multilateralism. Gender-blind or non-inclusive climate action is a risk multiplier. Within certain geographies, impact is particularly evident in societies where women often play central roles in agriculture and resource management. This is well documented but not often used to prompt change in policies. As climate change disrupts these activities, it not only jeopardises the livelihoods of women and exacerbates existing gender inequalities, but it also further risks long-term economic security of a state. A 2014 study found that in societies where the socioeconomic status of women is low, natural disasters kill more women than men – both directly and indirectly through related post-disaster events. For example, around  70% of the fatalities from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami were women. Any policy that does not consider inclusivity is likely to fail in the long term.Ideally, regional and global processes should be informed by hyperlocal socioeconomic realities. Climate action cannot be blanket and must be tailored to specific needs, while also learning from indigenous and local practices that have a history in resilience. Promoting inclusivity in multilateralism across the Indo-Pacific thus becomes a crucial baseline, with context-specific approaches that are collaborative in nature and consider local and regional perspectives.As an example, in the case of Australia, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s Development Policy commits to 80% gender equality in investments in partner countries around the world, with a commitment to ensure at least half of all projects will have a climate change objective. Efforts like this could move the needle on closing the climate financing gap alongside the needs of women – an important objective, since only about  0.01% of all worldwide funding supports projects that address both climate change and women’s rights. A  key example of a  collaborative approach is Australia’s support for the Gender Response Alternative for Climate Change, with ActionAid Australia, Monash University, and the Huairou Commission, a women-led grassroots social movement that supports rural and Indigenous communities.In navigating the intricate geopolitical terrain of the Indo-Pacific, a paradigm centered on a “partnership” rather than a “prescriptive” stance becomes imperative when applying a gender and inclusivity lens. Indo-Pacific climate multilateralism can glean valuable insights by building cooperative partnerships with local stakeholders well-versed in local risks and security. The inclusion of a gender lens, or the inclusion of perspectives from marginalised communities, does not necessitate major changes, but is a matter of breaking down silos and enhancing existing initiatives together. This ensures alignment that will ultimately be economically beneficial, and consequently provides robust security resilience. An often cited example of this is the Barefoot College’s “Solar Mama’s project – set up in partnership with governments, civil society, and the private sector – which trains largely rural and non-literate women in solar panel installation, enabling and empowering them to meet the needs of their community. From  2019-’20, Barefoot College trained 291 women, who would go on to bring clean energy solutions to 45,591 households in 626 communities around the world. This is also an income-generating opportunity for these women, contributing to their economic security and building community resilience; through another program under Barefoot College,  1,500 children were brought into the educational system who would have otherwise not had the opportunity to study.Similarly, India has sought to incorporate collaboration and inclusivity in global climate efforts through the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, which serve as platforms for Indo-Pacific and global south countries to voice their concerns, coordinate energy access, provide and receive disaster relief, and bolster resilience. These could be fortified by including a  gender action plan, formed in collaboration with other International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure members, that would take gender as a consideration during policy planning, recognise the differentiated impact of policies on women, and involve women as stakeholders in decision-making.As part of its recent stint as host of the G20 in 2023, India led the formation of a  disaster reduction working group, which could learn from the principles of the already existing Sendai Framework that recognises the vulnerabilities women face and the extensive role they play in disaster risk reduction.The challenges from climate change remain common, but its manifestations are varied. Integrating climate action into Indo-Pacific policies in a manner that is inclusive and equitable requires a holistic approach that considers the interconnectedness of environmental, economic, and social dimensions. Our research on the growing feminist foreign policy discourse as well as on the gender policies of Indo-Pacific players indicate that this is possible. It becomes a matter of connecting these strategies to their climate goals. Climate policies should not exist in isolation, but must be interwoven into broader policy frameworks, reflecting the complexity of the region.Ambika Vishwanath is the Founding Director of Kubernein Initiative, a geopolitical advisory based in Mumbai, India.

What does his move to BJP mean for state’s politics?,"In December 2019, when a movement against the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act erupted in Assam, Dipanka Kumar Nath was at its forefront.Nath was then the president of the All Assam Students’ Union or AASU, an organisation with a history of leading the “anti-foreigners” Assam agitation in the 1980s. In Assam, the law, which opens the door to Indian citizenship for non-Muslims from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, triggered old fears of being overrun by undocumented migrants – an anxiety that has driven the state’s politics since the 1970s. The AASU, which is committed to the idea of Assamese nationalism and perceives the “influx” of people from Bangladesh – whether Hindu or Muslim – as an existential threat to the state, took to the streets. The protests brought the entire state, especially the state capital Guwahati, to a standstill. The law was put in cold storage after widespread protests across the country.Over four years down the line, statements by Bharatiya Janata Party leaders from West Bengal, promising that the law will be implemented soon, have again stoked fears and protests in Assam. But this time, Nath is not mobilising crowds against the law. Last month, the leader joined the BJP, the party whose government at the Centre pushed through the law.The political U-turn has led to sharp reactions in the state, with AASU leaders pillorying Nath as a traitor to the cause of Assamese subnationalism. “He has not only betrayed AASU but also the lakhs of people who took to the streets following his appeal during the anti-CAA movement,” Utpal Sarma, the current president of AASU and once a close aide of Nath, told Scroll.Lurinjyoti Gogoi, former AASU general secretary, who also spearheaded the protests against the citizenship law, said Nath’s U-turn “was an insult to Assamese jatiyotabad (nationalism).” Observers of the state’s politics, however, point out that Nath’s switch is one more sign that Assamese nationalism, which privileged a linguistic ethnic identity over religion, has been tamed by the Hindutva politics of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Nath, who is in his fifties, headed AASU, the biggest students’ body in the North East for eight years between 2015 and 2022.He was a member of the central committee, the outfit’s highest decision-making body, for 30 years.In 2019-’20, along with Lurinjyoti Gogoi, he powered the street protests against the citizenship law.In the months following the anti-CAA protests, Nath also emerged as an advocate for a regional alternative in Assam, one that would speak for the interests of the ethnic Assamese. “He was among the first AASU leaders who proposed the formation of a regional party,” Gogoi told Scroll.For some years now, a large section of middle-class Assamese have grown disenchanted with the Congress, which is seen as a party that favoured Muslim migrants in the past. The Asom Gana Parishad, the party which emerged out of the Assam Movement, was in alliance with the BJP during the protests against CAA. In September 2020, efforts of the two largest and most influential student outfits in the state, the AASU and the Asom Jatiyotabadi Chhatra Parishad, led to the formation of one such alternative – the Asam Jatia Parishad.Gogoi quit AASU to become the president of Asam Jatia Parishad in December 2020. But though Nath quit AASU in 2022, he did not join the Parishad.“Nath has betrayed us for his own political career,” Gogoi said.In his defence, Nath has said that he was convinced about joining the BJP because the Himanta Biswa Sarma has succeeded in “solving many issues”, which were on the AASU agenda in the last three decades.For instance, he was appreciative of last year’s delimitation exercise, which the Sarma government has said will enable “indigenous” communities to win at least 94 of 126 assembly seats and which, critics say, will reduce Muslim representation in the state. He also counted the Assam government’s success in clearing land belonging to the satras – neo-Vaishnavite monasteries of the state – from alleged Muslim encroachers and the eviction of Bengali-origin Muslim families from Darrang district, in which two people were shot dead, as reasons. “This party is working towards protecting the jaati (community),” Nath said at a joining ceremony at the state BJP headquarters in Guwahati.The BJP state leadership too underlined that the objectives of Assamese nationalists and the saffron party were now the same.Bhabesh Kalita, who heads the BJP’s state unit, pointed out the ideological similarity between BJP and AASU as both participated in the Assam Movement in 1983 for the deportation of “illegal immigrants”.“Our leader and Lok Sabha MP Atal Bihari Vajpayee actively participated against the anti-foreigners agitation in 1983,” he said, referring to the senior BJP leader’s visit to the state during those turbulent years. “AASU speaks about the protection of jaati (community) and maati (land). This is not only the slogan of BJP but we are also implementing it.”The convergence between the BJP and leaders of Assamese nationalism, political observers say, has long been coming. “[The idea that] Assamese nationalism acts as an oppositional force to the Hindu nationalist juggernaut is now old history,” political scientist Sanjib Baruah told Scroll. “The anti-CAA agitation was probably its last gasp.”Many leaders of AASU and Asom Gana Parishad joined the party a long time ago and others are in parties that are in alliance with the BJP.“The political opposition with roots in the Assam movement has nearly collapsed,” Baruah said.  In the 2021 assembly elections, the BJP was able to successfully counter the anger against the CAA, by banking on development schemes and projecting itself as a “protector” of the Assamese community. Baruah argued that replacing Sarbananda Sonowal with Himanta Biswa Sarma as the chief minister was key to managing the opposition to the citizenship law. “They wanted someone more effective than Sonowal,” said Baruah. “Having built his career as an uncompromising warrior in the cause of khilonjia or indigenous interests, Sonowal was too tied to the legacy of the Assam Movement to do an about-turn on the issue.” Under Himanta Biswa Sarma, however, the BJP has deflected attention away from the Citizenship Act by carrying out a programme of hardline Hindutva, which has successfully pandered to both “jatiyotabadi” and Hindutva supporters of the society.From a peace agreement with the United Liberation Front of Asom, an insurgent group that fought for an independent Assamese state, to the evictions of Muslims, which continually added to the perception of the community as “illegal” migrants, to a proposed uniform civil code, the BJP government has projected itself as a protector of indigenous Assamese interests. “The Himanta government has given many things to keep Assamese nationalists occupied and happy in order to undermine Assamese nationalism,” said a political observer, who requested not to be identified.A day after Nath’s shift to the BJP, Union Minister of State for Shipping and BJP MP from West Bengal’s Santanu Thakur reiterated that the Citizenship Amendment Act would be implemented in the country within a week – from which he later backtracked. Nevertheless, a section of civil society groups of Assam led by the anti-CAA forum, Coordination Committee Against Citizenship Amendment Act, organised a sit-in demonstration in Guwahati demanding the repeal of CAA on February 3. Deben Tamuly, the committee’s chief coordinator, said, “People will oppose the CAA and it still holds significance in Assam’s politics.” Activist-turned  MLA Akhil Gogoi of Raijor Dal, one of the parties formed after the CAA stir, also protested at the Assam Assembly premises.    “The BJP government had promised to free us from foreigners’ issues,” Gogoi said. “Instead, over 15-20 lakh Hindu Bangaladeshi people will get Indian citizenship in Assam if CAA is implemented. Instead of solving foreigners’ issues, they are imposing more foreigners on us.”     Sarma, the AASU president, said that the organisation is committed in its opposition to the citizenship law as there is no place for illegal immigration in Assam. “The regional sentiment is always there in the minds of Assamese people,” the AASU leader said. “It just needs to be triggered as the CAA did in 2019.”   Not everyone is convinced that the ethnic Assamese will take to the streets this time around, too. “Subnationalism or Assamese nationalism consciousness is getting diluted,” said Chandan Kumar Sharma, who teaches sociology at Tezpur University. “But I don’t see its seamless merging with pan- Indian nationalism. For instance, the CAA still holds significance in Upper Assam. Whether that will translate into votes is tough to say.” ","Former AASU leader Dipanka Kumar Nath’s decision is one more sign, say observers, of the triumph of Hindutva politics over Assamese nationalism.",None,None,None,Rokibuz Zaman,bangladesh,2024-02-09 06:30:00,2024-02-09 07:00:00
https://scroll.in/article/1063331/uttarakhand-more-tunnelling-disasters-in-store-as-norms-are-disregarded-amid-infrastructure-push,Uttarakhand: More tunnelling disasters in store as norms are disregarded amid infrastructure push,"In the early morning of November 12, 2023, a 57 metre wide section of an under-construction road tunnel in Uttarakhand suddenly collapsed. A heap of  sediments and boulders blocked the tunnel entrance, trapping 41 workers.Over the following 17 days, the world watched as state, national, and international organisations worked with experts, and “rat-hole” miners to achieve the final breakthrough to rescue all 41 workers.The success of the rescue, though, overshadowed persistent complaints about design and construction in the 4.53-kilometre tunnel being constructed between Silkyara and Barkot, in Uttarakhand.The tunnel did not have the mandatory escape passage that could have assisted with the rescue. Moreover, the tunnel’s alignment  is along shear zones. These are zones formed by highly deformed, and  poor-quality rock masses that may collapse if not secured well during  construction, said engineering geologist Varun Adhikari – one of the  experts involved in the rescue at Silkyara.In an emailed response  to queries sent by The Third Pole, authorities at the National Highways  and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited, the agency  overseeing the project’s execution, said that the construction “adopted  necessary support [measures] and safety norms as per IRC [Indian Roads  Congress] guidelines”. It further added that based on “the  recommendation of [the] Authority Engineer [who is responsible for  taking critical construction-related decisions], necessary supporting  measures were taken…to overcome the sheared zone problems”.However, in a LinkedIn post  a day after the collapse, Adhikari pointed out faults in the  reprofiling work, which is the work done in the tunnel to ensure it  matches the required design dimensions. His post alleged that this work  “was done in a haphazard manner”.An expert who assisted during the rescue at Silkyara, speaking on the  condition of anonymity to The Third Pole, said that construction norms  were overlooked to speed up completion and cut costs. An engineer  working with National Highways  and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited, again speaking on the condition of anonymity, said  that the geotechnical investigation to ascertain properties of rock mass  along the tunnel length was done by boring holes at three places. Pramod C Nawani, senior engineering geologist and former director at the  Geological Survey of India, said that a geotechnical investigation for a  4.53-kilometre tunnel with just three holes was “insufficient and not  acceptable” in the Himalayas, where rock types can be very different  over even short distances.Across the Himalayan region, a number  of countries are using tunnels for large infrastructure projects like  roads, railways, hydropower, irrigation, and managing water supply. But,  due to such diverse types of projects that incorporate tunnelling,  limited data is available on the number of tunnels, and tunnel-related  accidents in the region.A 2022  study  reviewing nine tunnelling projects in the Himalayan regions of India,  Pakistan, Bhutan, and Nepal looks at the problem beyond political  borders. The study states that tunnelling faces challenges due to the  complex interactions between several geological and geotechnical  factors. Common problems are water ingress in tunnels, and accidents  from tunnelling through sections with poor-quality rock, like shear  zones. The study suggests “proper site exploration and careful planning”  as being critical to tunnelling in the region successfully.Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator, South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and  People, emphasised that guidelines existed to ensure safety, during and  after tunnelling, as well as to minimise impacts to the local  population and the environment. The real problem, he told The Third  Pole, was that guidelines were not thoroughly implemented, and the  required assessments, especially those concerning environmental impacts,  were superficially done for faster completion and cost-cutting  purposes.In the case of the Silkyara-Barkot tunnel, which is part  of the 825-kilometre Char Dham national highways widening project,  environment assessments have been bypassed. In any expansion of a  national highway for more than 100 kilometres, a prior environmental  impact assessment is necessary. But, to evade the assessment, the Char  Dham project has been divided into 53 sections, each one of them less than 100 kilometres in length.The flouted norms become that much more significant given that there have been several tunnel-related disasters in Uttarakhand.In 2007, after the tunnel of Jaiprakash Power Ventures Limited’s 400 MW Vishnuprayag hydropower project began leaking, 12 families were relocated from Chaien village.In 2016, Indian railway ministry’s project implementation unit, Rail  Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), began work on a 125-kilometre railway  project between the towns of Rishikesh and Karnaprayag, which required  extensive tunnelling. Among the several tunnels being constructed for  the project, an adit – a tunnel connecting the railway tunnels to the  highway – is under-construction 100 metres from Sweeth village. Speaking  to The Third Pole, a Sweeth resident, Anil Tiwari, 41, and the gram  pradhan (elected village head), Rajendar Mohan, 43, alleged that several  houses had been damaged by blasts from the construction.A survey  conducted in 2021 by the Uttarakhand government’s Geology and Mining  Unit found minor and major damages to nearly 224 houses in the village. A  copy of the survey report is with The Third Pole.Om Prakash  Malguri, Deputy General Manager, RVNL (Rishikesh-Karnaprayag project),  though, told The Third Pole, that the damage was not from the blasts  since a method called “controlled blasting” was used to minimise  impacts, and that ground vibration monitoring tests were also conducted  to keep the impacts from blasts in check.In another village, Maroda, houses were severely damaged after slope-cutting work for the project began in 2021.On February 7, 2021, a flood in the Rishiganga and Dhauliganga  valleys in the state, left at least 204 people dead. These included up  to 37 workers who died in the tunnels  of the state-owned NTPC Limited’s under-construction 520 MW Tapovan  Vishnugad hydropower project. The incident underlined the need for  better disaster preparedness, like the installation of early warning systems.Then, in November 2023, the Silkyara-Barkot tunnel collapsed. The impacts of tunnelling in mountain areas are often hard to assess,  owing to the lack of scientific data and analysis. One example of this  is the town of Joshimath – where at least 868 houses have been damaged from land subsidence, or sinking. While the sinking began in 2021, most damage happened in January 2023.  Activist Atul Sati, who is a Joshimath resident, claimed that one of  the key reasons behind the sinking land was the 12-kilometre  under-construction head race tunnel of the Tapovan Vishnugad hydropower  project.The tunnel is about 1.1 kilometres from Joshimath, and  Sati said that it may have stored water from the February 2021 flood in  the Dhauliganga river. The water, he claimed, would have oozed out of  Joshimath’s Marwari locality in January 2023, and left cavities in the  ground that escalated the existing land sinking problem.Preliminary assessments done by expert agencies,  like the Geological Survey of India and the National Institute of  Hydrology-Roorkee, have denied the project’s role in land sinking.  Others disagree. Navin Juyal is one such senior geologist who has been  working on the issue. He told The Third Pole, “The region has  crystalline and quartzite rocks that do not have huge cavities to store  large amounts of water that can sustain the heavy flow that was  witnessed at Marwari for several days.” According to Juyal, the only  visible cavity was the NTPC tunnel where flood water may have been  stored.Juyal said that more thorough scientific analysis by  independent agencies and experts was required to understand the tunnel’s  actual role in land sinking.The general consensus among experts like Juyal, senior engineering  geologist Nawani, and senior geologist Charu C Pant that The Third Pole  spoke to, was that tunnelling itself – as a construction technique – was  not the issue so much as lapses in following guidelines. For railway  and road-related tunnels, these experts said that if built by  experienced agencies after conducting thorough scientific investigations  and by following existing norms, such tunnels are more reliable than  cutting huge swatches of hills and mountains for wide roads.“Cutting  hills and mountains for roads may make them landslide-prone, but this  problem does not exist with tunnels,” said Nawani.Moreover, the  large numbers of trees cut, land acquired, and people impacted during  road construction, are much less during tunnelling, he said.In Uttarakhand, there is an ongoing rush for infrastructure  expansion. One of the key reasons is tourism. With a population of 10  million in 2011 when the last census was conducted, Uttarakhand hosted  over 54 million domestic tourists in 2022, with the Chief Minister declaring his intent to expand it to 70 million  based on infrastructure projects like Char Dham. The other major  project being built to cater to the large influx of pilgrims visiting  important Hindu and Sikh shrines in the state, as well as tourists is  the RVNL’s railway project, which involves 213 kilometres of tunnelling  work.For the Indian government, national security is an added  reason to undertake such infrastructure projects. According to the  Ministry of Defence, 674 kilometres of the total 825 kilometres being  widened under the Char Dham project are feeder roads that lead to the  Indo-China border, and hence are of strategic importance.Construction of hydropower projects is another major infrastructure-related activity in the region. A 2019 study  revealed that the commercially feasible hydropower potential of four  Hindu Kush Himalayan countries – India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Bangladesh –  is about 190 GW, of which only one-third has currently been tapped.In  Uttarakhand, the state government-owned UJVN Limited states that  hydropower projects with 4,183.10 MW installed capacity are  operational, and projects with 9,706.6 MW installed capacity are under  construction. With an estimated identified hydropower potential of 27,039 MW, the state and central governments continue to push for such projects.When  it comes to tunnels, depending on the design, hydropower projects may  have a head race tunnel to transport water from the intake to the  powerhouse for electricity generation; a tail race tunnel to release  water used for electricity generation back into the river in the  downstream; adits (passages) for allowing access to tunnels, and surge  shafts to manage water pressure inside the tunnel. The powerhouse and  desilting chambers could also require construction of large underground  structures or caverns.Engineering geologist Adhikari said,  “Railway and road tunnels are built for people and vehicles. Hence,  their design – from tunnel dimensions, to ventilation, and emergency  features like escape tunnels – ensures some safety.”Such safety  measures might be absent in hydropower tunnels that are primarily  designed to transport water, he said, posing a threat to those who build  them. To complicate matters, extreme rainfall events have been increasing  in Uttarakhand, according to the India Meteorological Department. These  increase the risks in tunnel construction and operation. On August 13,  2023, 114 workers were trapped in an under-construction railway tunnel  in Shivpuri, Uttarakhand, following heavy rains that led to water being  filled up in the tunnel, police personnel from the Shivpuri police  outpost told The Third Pole. The workers were rescued after hours of  efforts by the police.  Despite mounting risks, current tunnelling norms are yet to take into  consideration climate change impacts. Matthew Westoby,  a geomorphologist at the UK-based University of Plymouth has been  working on extreme floods-related sediment transport problems in Uttarakhand. He told The Third Pole that muck from tunnelling – which is often illegally dumped into or along streams and rivers – could exacerbate flood hazard by being transported into rivers during extreme weather events or extreme floods.Tunnelling  may also disturb the subsurface geological flowpaths of water, altering  the flow from the recharge area to the actual point of spring  emergence, said Christopher Scott from the US-based Pennsylvania State  University. Scott previously served as the Mountain Chair  at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development. Across  the length of RVNL’s Rishikesh-Karnaprayag railway project reports have come of springs going dry.During  The Third Pole’s visit to Atali in December 2023, a 65-year-old  resident, Dhaneshwari Devi, walked across the village, geared to work in  the field. But, due to the land consumed by tunnelling for the RVNL  project, there were hardly any fields left to attend. All the  springs had gone dry.Just a few metres away was the national highway that had been widened under the Char Dham tourism project.A resentful Dhaneshwari said, “On the earth, they are cutting the hills to provide wider roads for tourists; and beneath our feet, they are digging tunnels, also for them. Does our homeland belong to us or the tourists?”   Kavita Upadhyay is an independent journalist and researcher who writes on the  interlinkages between disasters, infrastructure, and climate change in  the Indian Himalayan Region.

Both sides remain undefeated in the competition and have overcome feisty opponents like England, New Zealand, and Bangladesh.But their respective journeys to the knockout stage have been far from smooth. Both teams had to overcome challenging phases of play in adverse circumstances, something that held especially true for Pakistan in their Super Six encounters.While these jolts keep them battle-ready for the semi-finals, it also makes them aware of the areas that need improvement.Australia and Pakistan are blessed with top-notch pace attacks and also have crafty spinners in their lineups. To add to that, their top-order batters have shown great form.With immense talent in their ranks and a propensity to play positive cricket, a must-win contest between these two line-ups has all the makings of a nail-biter.AustraliaForm guide (in the tournament): NR W W W WHugh Weibgen’s side were grouped with Namibia, Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka.Led by Callum Vidler, the pacers wreaked havoc in their opening encounter against Namibia, bowling out the African side for 91. However, Namibia’s fast bowlers stood tall and had Australia in a spot of bother at 57/5. A patient knock from skipper Weibgen halted Namibia’s momentum and saw them through by four wickets.A more rounded batting performance followed against Zimbabwe, where Harry Dixon’s 89 guided them to a strong total before Harkirat Bajwa’s 4/15 dismantled the chase. The final group clash against Sri Lanka saw a classy 77* from Ryan Hicks rescue the side after Australia’s top-order fell by the wayside at the start of the second Powerplay.In their first Super Six game against England, the Australia top-order was once again among the runs, with Weibgen’s vibrant ton leading the charge. Their bowlers then pressed the advantage of scoreboard pressure in a rain-affected encounter and secured a massive win.However, the batting slipped up once more against a charged-up West Indies in their final Super Six encounter yet a splendid century from Sam Konstas helped them to post a competitive total of 227/8. With Charlie Anderson’s early breakthroughs, the contest had all the makings of a thriller, but rain intervention meant the game ended without a result. Their undefeated run ensured that they topped Group 2 of the Super Six, and entered the semi-finals.PakistanForm guide (in the tournament): W W W W WPakistan were placed in Group D along with Afghanistan, Nepal, and New Zealand.The group games were relatively smooth sailing for Saad Baig’s team. Shahzaib Khan’s 106 set the tone for a substantial total against Afghanistan, even as Saad contributed with an attacking fifty. Pacers Ubaid Shah and Mohammad Zeeshan were relentless as Pakistan won the game by 181 runs.A valiant effort from Nepal challenged them in their second game. Nepal batted out their 50 overs, before having Pakistan in a spot of bother at 104/4. A patient 63 from Azan Awais then pulled Pakistan through to victory in East London.But Pakistan were back to their very best in the final group encounter against the Kiwis. Shah’s scintillating opening spell saw the back of the top order before Arafat Minhas ran through the tail with his three-wicket haul. An attacking 80* from Khan’s won Pakistan the game by 10 wickets.In the Super Six phase, after bowling out Ireland for a modest 181, Pakistan’s batting was tested. Ahmad Hassan’s 57* pulled them out of trouble this time, guiding them to a three-wicket win.A net run rate tussle brewed up in their final Super Six encounter against Bangladesh. Despite a sturdy start for Pakistan, Sheikh Jibon and Rohanat Doullah Borson bowled exceptionally well to clean up their subcontinental rivals for 155.It took Shah’s 5/44 backed by some exceptional fielding to see Pakistan home by a five run margin in a low-scoring thriller. With eight points in their kitty, they finished second in Group 1, sitting behind India on the basis of run rate.Australia’s skipper Weibgen has also been their anchor in the tournament. He began the tournament with a brisk 39* from 43, which helped close out a risky chase against Namibia.A solid 68 from 69 balls assisted Dixon in the second game versus Zimbabwe. He failed to get going in the third game but opened the Super Six with a stroke-filled 120 against England. He hit 15 fours in a knock that saw him bat for over three hours. This hundred laid the foundation for a massive Australian win.Besides impessing with the bat, Weibgen has been an active captain on the field. He has been smart with his bowling changes and overall leadership.Khan’s rock-solid presence at the top is a big plus for a mercurial Pakistan batting lineup. He was the Player of the Match in two of their group encounters, contributing with a hundred against Afghanistan, and an unbeaten half-century against New Zealand.The southpaw also ensured stable starts for Pakistan in low-scoring chases against Nepal and Bangladesh respectively.Given the recent troubles of the middle-order batters, Khan’s innings at the top will be an important factor for Pakistan in the semi-final against a quality attack.Vidler’s pinpoint accuracy, pace and movement have seen him stand out for Australia. Despite missing a game and hardly bowling in the rain-affected encounter against West Indies, the bowler already has 11 wickets to his name.Eight of these wickets came in the form of match-winning four-wicket hauls against Namibia and England.Along with Mahli Beardman and Anderson, Vidler can give Australia the early advantage on 6 February in Benoni.Shah stands joint second in the wicket-taking charts at the U19 Men’s CWC 2024, sitting behind South Africa speedster Kwena Maphaka.Beginning with a 4/26 against Afghanistan, the pacer hasn’t looked back. His skillful display with both the new and old ball has meant that the bowler has made an impact in all stages of the game and helped Pakistan come back into matches at crucial junctures.This came to the fore against Bangladesh when Shah overcame the ignominy of having dropped a catch to pick the crucial wicket of Mohammad Shihab James in the very next over, changing the momentum of the match and helping Pakistan secure a famous win.Australia: Harry Dixon, Sam Konstas, Hugh Weibgen (c), Harjas Singh, Ryan Hicks (wk), Tom Campbell, Raf MacMillan, Harkirat Bajwa, Charlie Anderson, Mahli Beardman, Callum VidlerPakistan: Shamyl Hussain, Shahzaib Khan, Azan Awais, Saad Baig (c) (wk), Ahmad Hassan, Haroon Arshad, Arafat Minhas, Ali Asfand, Ubaid Shah, Mohammad Zeeshan, Ali Raza",The winner of the semi-final will meet India in the final on Sunday,None,None,None,Scroll Staff,bangladesh,2024-02-07 21:45:00,2024-02-07 22:15:00

Remarkably, five different players from the team have notched up centuries to date at the tournament.However, they have notfaced a bowling attack of South Africa’s calibre yet, which is spearheaded by the tournament’s top wicket-taker, Kwena Maphaka.The left-arm pacer has effortlessly dismantled opposing batting lineups, claiming three five-wicket hauls along the way. India will, however, take confidence from the fact that they successfully negated him in the tri-series preceding the World Cup.The Proteas’ opening batters, Steve Stolk and Lhuan-dre Pretorius, have showcased exceptional form, leading the charge for South Africa.South Africa have only stumbled once in the tournament – against England in the group stages. But the hosts have momentum on their side with dominant victories thereafter – among their highlights has been their explosive chase of 273 runs for victory in 27 overs against Scotland to secure top spot in the group stages.IndiaForm guide (in the tournament): W W W W WIndia commenced their tournament with a commanding 84-run victory over Bangladesh, led by Saumy Pandey’s impressive four-wicket haul.In the following match against Ireland, Musheer Khan’s century propelled India beyond the 300-run mark, with Naman Tiwari contributing a four-wicket haul for a resounding 201-run win.The momentum continued as the defending champions breached 300 runs once more, this time against the USA. Opener Arshin Kulkarni passed three figures this time, before Tiwari recorded successive four-fors as India emerged victors by the same margin.The Super Six stage then rolled around, and up against New Zealand, Khan showcased his brilliance with a second century, setting a target of 296. Pandey’s four wickets dismantled any hope of a chase, as the Blackcaps were bowled out for just 81.Centuries from captain Uday Saharan and Sachin Dhas laid the foundation for a big total of 297/5 in their final super Six match against Nepal. Pandey’s left-arm spin wreaked havoc once again, leading to a 131-run victory as India punched their tickets to the semi-finals.South AfricaForm guide (in the tournament): W W L W WThe hosts started off their tournament with a thrilling win over West Indies in a closely contested match. Maphaka’s scintillating five-for trumped Jewel Andrew’s valiant ton as the Proteas won by 31 runs.South Africa then suffered their first and only defeat, losing out against England by 36 runs (DLS) in a rain-truncated match.However, they bounced back in style by chasing 273 in 27 overs against Scotland. Stolk smashed a fifty off just 13 balls, the fastest in U19 Men’s World Cup history and was well supported by Dewan Marais’s 50-ball 80.In their first outing in the Super Six stage, Maphaka’s second five-wicket haul restricted Zimbabwe to a lowly 102. South Africa launched another explosive chase to secure a comfortable win in just 13.3 overs, with Lhaun-dre Pretorius contributing a quickfire half-century.In their final Super Six game, Sri Lanka’s bowling posed a challenge, restricting the hosts to a modest 232 runs. However, Maphaka’s outstanding six-wicket haul tore through Sri Lanka’s batting lineup, securing South Africa’s qualification and a blockbuster matchup against India in the semi-final with an emphatic 119-run victory.Khan has been a revelation for India in the tournament so far, leading the run-scoring charts with 334 runs at an impressive strike rate of 103.72. Beyond his batting prowess, Khan has also proved handy with the ball, scalping four wickets at an economy rate of 3.01.Closely behind Khan in the list for most runs is captain Saharan with 308. A pillar in the middle order, he has momentum on his side after a century in the last game against Nepal.It has been hard to keep Pandey out of any game in the tournament to date, with the left-arm spinner bagging at least three wickets in four of the five games so far.Currently third in the wicket-takers list with 16 wickets, Pandey will be looking to climb to the top but the brilliant Maphaka stands in his way at the summit of the bowling charts with 18. The left-arm quick has earned plaudits from some of the greats of the game for his speed and ability to move the ball early.Among the Proteas batters, the responsibility will primarily rest on the shoulders of openers Stolk and Pretorius to provide a strong start for South Africa.Stolk has taken the tournament by storm, his 214 runs coming at a blazing strike rate of 148.6. Together with Pretorius, the pair have added 360 runs, the highest for any pair in the tournament, at a stunning strike rate of 141.2.India: Uday Saharan (C), Aravelly Avanish (wk), Adarsh Singh, Arshin Kulkarni, Musheer Khan, Priyanshu Moliya, Sachin Dhas, Murugan Abhishek, Naman Tiwari, Raj Limbani, Saumy Pandey.South Africa: Juan James (C), Lhuan-dre Pretorius (wk), Steve Stolk, David Teeger, Richard Seletswane, Dewan Marais, Romashan Pillay, Riley Norton, Tristan Luus, Nqobani Mokoena, Kwena Maphaka.",The in-form Indian batting lineup will be up against the World Cup’s leading wicket taker Kwena Maphaka in the semi-finals.,None,None,None,Scroll Staff,bangladesh,2024-02-05 17:35:00,2024-02-05 18:05:00

Misra’s works are confrontational and challenge and provoke readers morally, politically, and in their expectations of literature. The Earth Quakes: Late Anti-Stories brings together his final creations: 20 stories written between 1991 and 2010, their subjects ranging from the “global” – the Gulf War of 1991, which heralded the post-Cold War unipolar world – to the very “local” – the Singur movement of 2006 that led to the unseating of the all-powerful CPI(M), which had ruled the state of West Bengal since 1977.One summer morning in 1977, 19-year-old Lorenzo Senesi of Aquilina, Italy, drives his Vespa motorscooter into a speeding Fiat and breaks his forearm. It keeps him in bed for a month, and his boggled mind thinks of unfamiliar things: Where has he come from? Where is he going? And how to find out more about where he ought to go?When he recovers, he enrols for a physiotherapy course. He also joins a prayer group and visits Praglia Abbey, a Benedictine monastery in the foothills outside Padua.The monastery will become his home for ten years, its isolation and discipline the anchors of his life, and then send him to a Benedictine ashram in faraway Bangladesh – a village in Khulna district, where monsoon clouds as black as night descend right down to river and earth. He will spend many years here. He will pray seven times a day, learn to speak Bengali and wash his clothes in the river, paint a small chapel, start a physiotherapy clinic to ease bodies out of pain, and fall, unexpectedly, in love. And he will find that a life of service to God is enough, but that it is also not enough.This is a study of the extraordinary experiences of an ordinary man, the majesty and the banality of the spiritual path.A sprawling novel set in the north-east of India, this is a lyrical exploration of male friendships and love – a man’s love for a woman and a more militant love for community and nation. The action moves from Guwahati to Dhaka, Bhutan and London, surging and quietening as we encounter characters and situations so close to the bone and universal in their conflict and despair. In the 21 stories of this collection, there is the city that labours in the mills and streets, the city that sips and nibbles in five-star lounges; the city of Ganapati and Haji Malang and the Virgin Mary; the city that is a sea of people and speaks at least a dozen languages. There are stories translated from Marathi, Urdu, Gujarati, Tamil, Hindi, Kannada, and Malayalam, and stories written originally in English. Among the writers are legends and new voices – Baburao Bagul, Ismat Chughtai, Pu La Deshpande, Urmila Pawar, Mohan Rakesh, Saadat Hasan Manto, Ambai, Jayant Kaikini, Bhupen Khakhar, Cyrus Mistry, Vilas Sarang, Tejaswini ApteRahm, and Anuradha Kumar.So how do you get the spirit of India’s great metropolis, the Maya Nagari, the city of dreams, between the covers of a book? Shanta Gokhale and Jerry Pinto decided to bring together their favourite short stories about the city they call home, and hope that a narrative will emerge. And it does – a rich, varied, vibrant portrait of the republic that goes by many names – Bombay, Mumbai, Momoi, Bambai and many others.  Suryakant Tripathi “Nirala” was among the maverick writers who shaped modern Hindi literature. In his prose writings, Nirala regards the world with the eyes of a compulsive satirist, committed to laying bare its hypocrisies. A Portrait of Love is an ode to Nirala’s genius, drawing attention to his long-ignored legacy in prose. From his poignant yet humorous sketch of rural India in Billesur Bakriha to the sophisticated urbanity of Lucknow in “Portrait of a Lady-Love”; from questioning the ideals of marriage and love in “Sukul’s Wife” to celebrating the nexus between writers and courtesans in colonial Calcutta in “What I Saw”; from hailing agency among the oppressed castes in “Chaturi Chamar” to shining a light on an uneasy relationship between education and progress in “Jyotirmayee” – the collection takes the readers to the heart of India and the colourful cosmos of Hindi literature.  Jayant Kaikini’s stories are tinged with melancholy but lit with hope, capturing moments of transcendence amid anonymity and routine. Young men migrate to Mumbai looking for work or a more exciting life, while others, women and men, young and old, make the journey for different reasons. In this city that rules the dreams of people up and down the coast, strangers become friends, families negotiate strife and affection, and children grow up in homes where the lines between coercion and care are blurred.","A coming-of-age novel set in Assam, three short story collections in translation, a short fiction anthology about India’s biggest metropolis, and more.",None,None,None,Sayari Debnath,bangladesh,2024-02-04 07:30:00,2024-02-04 08:00:00

In 1990 she won Bengal’s Best Young Poet award. She started learning French at the age of 22 and moved to Paris a few years later. She has since been naturalised French. Her first novel, Fenêtre sur l’abîme, was published in 2008. Her second novel, Assommons les pauvres!, was published in 2011 and subsequently translated into German, Arabic, Italian and Hungarian, and adapted for stage in Germany and Austria. It was translated into English as Down With the Poor! by Teresa Lavender Fagan and published in 2022. Her third novel, Calcutta (2014), received the Prix du rayonnement de la langue et de la littérature françaises and the Grand Prix du Roman of the Société des gens de lettres. Her most recent novel, Le testament russe, was published in March 2020 by Éditions Gallimard.  She has also translated and published several anthologies of contemporary French and Bengali poetry in collaboration with her former husband, the poet Lionel Ray.   In a conversation hosted by the Jaipur Literature Festival, Sinha spoke about why French is her chosen, being a politically incorrect writer, and how writing has not exactly been cathartic for her. Excerpts from the conversation:You were born and grew up in Calcutta. You have even written in Bengali. Tell me about the moment – or the moments – that made you want to write in the French language instead.My attraction to the French language was from the very beginning, it was love at first sight when I started learning it in Calcutta when I was 22 years old. In my early years in Paris, people from Calcutta came to my dream, and spoke, in the muffled dreamy way, in French. I started writing a travelogue in Bengali, but it wasn’t working at all, after two or three pages I discovered that I was unconsciously thinking in French, and unconsciously translating myself from French into Bengali. Hence, I decided to write in French. But writing in French doesn’t happen because a decision is made, it happens because I breathe the language, I live in it, I can’t think in any other language anymore. The process of writing is cerebral and physical at the same time. Words, sentences gush and flow inside you. But as someone who was once far removed from your chosen language, is there any reason you decided it must be French in which you tell your stories?For the above-cited reasons, also, not writing in Bengali or in English, that is avoiding something given, so obvious, and searching for the unknown, is exciting, exhilarating. Rimbaud said that the true life is absent. We made a more optimistic version of it: the true life is elsewhere. I guess my elsewhere was in the French language. Jhumpa Lahiri, who now pretty much writes only in Italian, has often spoken about how writing in a once-foreign language has granted her certain freedoms that her birth language or English did not. Do you also feel freer when you write or speak in French?Unlike Jhumpa Lahiri, I haven’t pursued any literary career, even less a successful one, in my native language Bengali or in English, before writing in French. I wrote a few poems and poetical prose during my adolescence and early youth, published twice in a little magazine, but I seriously started writing only in French. Writing in French gives me extraordinary liberty and it’s on so many levels! As a woman I feel free, liberated from social patriarchal moral boundaries. The French language itself is full of linguistic possibilities, especially as I wasn’t born into it but had to explore it like an adventurer, my writing process gives me a fantastic opportunity to be experimental, to create linguistic inventiveness. Like your protagonist in Down With the Poor! you too used to work at OFPRA [French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons]. You lost your job because of your writing. Did you fear this might happen or was it a punishment for speaking up? I didn’t know that OFPRA had any literary taste buds, haha! So no, I didn’t anticipate at all that they might fire me. And yes, of course, it was a punishment for speaking up. They pretended that my novel was disrespectful to the people from Bengal/Bangladesh. That’s funny because OFPRA knows that these stories are untrue, yet that’s the only kind of story OFPRA accepts from these people, and in almost 100 per cent of cases rejects their application, and if ever they tell their true stories, they are also rejected instantly. This is a hypocritical system, as I’ve exposed in my novel. So of course, they didn’t tolerate it. It was interesting to read about Cox Bazar and Bangladeshi refugees are fully aware of how France will reject those seeking asylum unless they are disenfranchised politically. In a way, the system encourages them to fabricate their reality. What do you make of this hypocrisy?It’s a “factory of lies”, as I’ve written in the novel. The Geneva Treaty was signed in 1951. It was for political asylum. Since then, our planet has changed. Half of Bangladesh stays under the water for months. People don’t have access to their homes, lands. How can they survive? It’s an economic and ecological migration. It should be accepted and acknowledged as it is. In the capitalist ultra-liberal system, money circulates, commodities cross the border, and only men, proletarian men cannot move if they want to change their destiny. It’s revolting. At the very beginning of the novel, you write, “It was agonizing to see closed doors in a city, in a country I loved, when I had put so much effort into opening them.” I have two questions – a) Can a country with closed doors ever love its immigrants? b) What does the realisation of your efforts not bearing fruition have on the psyche of an immigrant?Well, this is fiction, even though, we know now it’s a very realistic one. I dramatise the characters and situations in my novels…For me personally, the doors are not closed, I wouldn’t be here today if that was the case. But for the main female protagonist of my novel, I created a more vulnerable, dramatised, dark condition. France is not a hostile country towards foreigners, otherwise, we the Others couldn’t be living there. Of course, there is a new growth of a faction of xenophobic ultranationalist force. However, the majority of the French population and the system itself are broad-minded. I don’t consider myself an immigrant. I don’t believe in a rigid one-dimensional identity. I am Bengali, I am Indian, I am Parisian, I am French, I am a little bit Russian too as I grew up devouring Russian literature, I am from the planet Earth. Our identity is not the one made of skin, flesh and blood, but the one we create for our soul, with our dreams and hopes, imagination, passion, love and knowledge, things that have no frontiers. Later in the book I encountered a rather fascinating sentence which has been translated into English as, “I endured hours of serious comedy.” I read “serious comedy” in two ways – the circumstances that the applicants find themselves in which force them to come up with cock-and-bull stories and, how we have let the West make rules for the rest of the world. Would you say writing these migration-centric stories helps you make sense of the world order? Or at least offer a catharsis of some sort?Very true! It’s a very realistic novel written in poetic prose, it’s a virulent criticism of the French/European political asylum system, exposing the postcolonial misery, distress, and trauma of people from Bangladesh and Bengalis from West Bengal, who are struggling to survive, looking for a better place, a better life. To do so they have to lie, to buy made-up stories from public writers, because that’s the kind of story, of political persecution, the French/European asylum system considers, just to reject their application afterwards systematically.These people are also exploited by their fellow countrymen, the middlemen, who make money out of the situation. The narrator, an interpreter at the asylum office, who greatly resembles me, is torn between her integrity, her desperate anger in front of this inhuman disastrous condition of her fellow countrymen. Writing this novel helped me better understand the world order. But it was definitely not a catharsis for me. The survival condition of these people hasn’t changed. They still live in an unbearable situation. That’s interesting because in another paragraph in the book the refugees are described as “parasites clinging to the host body.” So would you say it is sometimes necessary for a writer to be politically incorrect?For me as a writer, it is absolutely primordial to ignore political correctness. While writing Assommons les pauvres! I was absorbed by the text, I wasn’t looking for a critic’s appreciation, success, or popularity. I wasn’t concerned at all by any social or moral value system. As a writer I reject any binary dogmatic view, I do not try to create heroes/heroines and villains, but human beings with their flaws, their secret shadow zone, I try to capture the point of juncture between their inner darkness and the beam of light.  Is there a reason why only one of your books has been translated into English? Will the others be translated soon?Translation into different European languages of books written in English is more frequent than the other way around. It helps when you receive one of the most prestigious literary awards in France. Even though I’ve received excellent awards, and grand press coverage in France and abroad, there are lots of writers in France. Assommons les pauvres! was instantly translated into German, Italian, Hungarian, Arabic. Then I changed publisher – my latest books, including the new one, were all published by Gallimard, the most iconic and prestigious publisher in France. So, for my previous books, the translation process can be affected. Although my fourth novel Apatride [Stateless] has been translated into English, it’s following its due course to be published. The same goes for my other novels. Currently, three translators are very enthusiastic to translate all my novels into English. I’m happy to have a British and an American publisher for the same book. In India, some fantastic publishers publish translated works. If they discover my literary work, as a fellow citizen and recognised French author, thanks to you and the wonderful Jaipur Literature Festival, that would be great! The coming years will be interesting if everything goes well.
