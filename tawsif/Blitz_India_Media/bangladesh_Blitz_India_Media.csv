The gesture reflects not only the personal rapport between the two leaders but also the enduring friendship and cooperative spirit that has long characterised the bilateral relations between the two South Asian neighbours. Prime Minister Modi’s congratulatory message to Sheikh Hasina resonates with the historical bond that India and Bangladesh share. It is a bond forged in the crucible of Bangladesh’s struggle for independence, during which India played a pivotal role. Emphasising the importance of this relationship, Sheikh Hasina, in her victory speech, lauded India as a “great friend of Bangladesh,” acknowledging the support rendered by India during critical moments in Bangladesh’s history, including the Liberation War of 1971.  The recent victory of Sheikh Hasina marks a continuation of a stable and progressive regime in Bangladesh. Under her leadership, the country has seen significant strides in various sectors, contributing to its socioeconomic development. Prime Minister Modi’s acknowledgment of this victory underscores India’s commitment to strengthening its partnership with Bangladesh, a relationship that is both people-centric and enduring. The mutual recognition of friendship and cooperation extends beyond mere diplomatic niceties. It translates into tangible collaborations across various domains. Recently, India and Bangladesh signed seven Memorandum of Understanding (MoUs) aimed at enhancing cooperation in areas including water resources, capacity building, science and technology, and broadcasting. These agreements are a testament to the multifaceted nature of the IndoBangladesh partnership, underpinned by shared cultural ties, economic interests, and strategic cooperation.  In addition to these agreements, the inauguration of significant projects like the Maitree power plant and the Rupsha rail bridge, which are integral to enhancing connectivity and energy cooperation, mark a new chapter in the bilateral relations. These initiatives not only bolster economic ties but also pave the way for greater people-to-people contact, reinforcing the strong bond between the two nations. In conclusion, the re-election of Sheikh Hasina and the congratulatory message from Prime Minister Modi symbolise a reaffirmation of the strong and historic ties between India and Bangladesh. The continued collaboration and mutual support between the two nations are poised to usher in a new era of prosperity and partnership, reinforcing their status as not just neighbours but as great friends on the global stage."

In an interview to ANI, Momen said, “Over the last few years, under Indian leadership and our PM Sheikh Hasina, we have developed a solid relationship. We understand each other better.” Momen underscored the importance of maintaining strong ties with all neighbours for mutual prosperity, “So, we want to continue to do this because we believe unless you have good relations with all neighbours, you cannot prosper. You cannot make a neighbour an enemy,” he said. Describing the relationship as “excellent,” the minister expressed gratitude for India’s consistent support, especially during historical challenges. He recalled, “The relationship between India and Bangladesh is excellent. We suffered under Pakistani subjugation, they tortured us, and then we went to India. India supported us, helped us. Even the common people provided their support. So that’s the historical context.” Following the recent General Elections where PM Sheikh Hasina secured her fourth term, she outlined her plans for international relations, emphasising the strong bond between Bangladesh and India. Acknowledging India’s pivotal role in supporting Bangladesh during critical moments in history, she expressed gratitude towards India’s unwavering assistance. Touching upon the controversy surrounding the Maldives MP’s disparaging remarks about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Lakshadweep, Momen unequivocally condemned the comments, and termed them unacceptable."
bangladesh,https://blitzindiamedia.com/india-stands-firm-against-paks-bid-to-enter-brics/,India stands firm against Pak’s bid to enter BRICS,"January 11, 2024, 04:09 PM",2024-01-11,11-1-2024,": India is positioned to oppose Pakistan’s bid for full membership in the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) group, underscoring its commitment to preserve BRICS as a platform for emerging market economies. Pakistan is seeking to elevate its status within the group during Russia’s presidency, which commenced with a focus on ‘Strengthening Multilateralism for Equitable Global Development and Security’. India’s resistance to Pakistan’s full membership stems from the conviction that the inclusion of too broad a membership could dilute BRICS’s foundational character. Indian officials assert that Pakistan’s membership would not add value to the BRICS coalition. Concurrently, Saudi Arabia officially announced its accession to the BRICS bloc, a development reflecting the kingdom’s strategic pivot towards diverse economic partnerships amid shifting geopolitical dynamics and China’s expanding influence. The induction of Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE into BRICS this year reflects the bloc’s expanding consensus and its evolving role on the global stage. The development comes at a time when the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) is mired in dysfunction, primarily due to the fraught relationship between India and Pakistan. Notably, the 19th Saarc Summit, which was to be hosted by Pakistan in 2016, was postponed after India, Afghanistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka chose to boycott the event, citing unresolved tensions. These unfolding narratives in regional partnerships and global alliances underscore the delicate balance of cooperation and competition that defines international relations. India’s stance on Pakistan’s BRICS bid and the broader inclusion of Middle Eastern nations in the group signal a strategic approach to maintaining the group’s integrity while navigating the complex tapestry of emerging market economies and geopolitical interests. As the BRICS bloc adapts to include new partners, it faces the challenge of harmonising diverse economic and political agendas to forge a cohesive path forward."

The 76-year-old leader, who has been ruling the strategically located South Asian nation since 2009, secured a fifth overall term in the one-sided election on Sunday, which witnessed a low turnout. “India is a great friend of Bangladesh. They have supported us in 1971 and also in 1975. They gave shelter to me and my sister and my other family members,” she said, referring to her period in exile when she stayed in India for six years after the killing of her family members. In August 1975, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, his wife and their three sons were assassinated in their home by military officers. His daughters Hasina and Rehana survived the purge as they were abroad. “We consider India as our next-door neighbour. We had many problems but we resolved it bilaterally. So, I really appreciate that we have a wonderful relationship with India,” she said while responding to a question."

The event is celebrating its two decades of success this year. According to media reports, the presence of key global leaders, including Mozambique’s President Filipe Nyusi, is expected. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a formal invitation to President Al Nahyan during the COP28 Summit in Dubai underlining the strengthening of ties between India and the UAE. Initiated by PM Modi during his Chief Ministerial tenure in 2003, the Vibrant Gujarat Summit has evolved into a vital platform attracting top-tier business leaders, investors, and policymakers. The summit’s growth with each edition reflects its pivotal role in advancing India’s economic agenda. The forthcoming Vibrant Gujarat Summit is expected to draw diverse delegations from several countries, with robust participation from Russia and African nations. The event consistently attracts foreign leaders and investors, showcasing Gujarat as a key investment destination. Sixteen partner countries and fourteen partner organisations have confirmed attendance so far for the 2024 edition themed ‘Gateway to the Future.’ The partner countries in 2014 include Japan, Finland, Morocco, Republic of Korea, Mozambique, Estonia, UAE, Australia, UK, Netherlands, Norway, Nepal, Thailand, Bangladesh, Germany, and Egypt."

The 83-year-old economist won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his anti-poverty campaign, earning Bangladesh the reputation of being the home of microcredit through his Grameen Bank, which he founded in 1983. Yunus and three of his colleagues in Grameen Telecom– one of the firms he founded– were accused of violating labour laws when they failed to create a workers’ welfare fund in the company. The Third Labour Court Judge Sheikh Merina Sultana ordered Yunus to serve six months of simple or non-rigorous imprisonment for violating the law as the Grameen Telecom chairman, along with three other executives of the social business company."
bangladesh,https://blitzindiamedia.com/bangladesh-a-dampened-durga-puja/,Bangladesh A dampened Durga Puja,"November 09, 2023, 01:28 PM",2023-11-09,9-11-2023,"DURGA Puja in Bangladesh observed with great fervour by nearly one crore Hindu minority is now over after immersion of the deities in Buriganga river on October 24. All police bandobast was in place to ensure law and order and tranquil as the communal fanatics were thought to cause disturbances. This apprehension came from the fact that many Durga idols were desecrated at regular intervals immediately preceding the commencement of the puja celebrations fuelling a sense of insecurity amongst the Hindus who are already reeling with threats of losing their immobile possessions, forced conversions in many cases and other perils posed to the shrinking number of the minority lot.Having said this, it shouldn’t be insinuated that the government or the local administration didn’t extend appropriate security measures to provide security to instill safety. The zealots in the political parties and possibly also in a segment of the government, have prevailed over the government for certain undesirable and sensitive steps which construed dampeners to the long awaited DurgaPuja which numbers nearly over 34,000 pandals all over Bangladesh. To illustrate the point, more specifically, certain district administrations like Hobigunj, Kumillaetc issued notifications.  Objectively speaking, the notifications were insensitive, looking intimidatory. Why? Because they said that Prasads shouldn’t contain any thing intoxicating, there shouldn’t be any loud celebrations causing ‘high‘ decibels of noise. Hindu activists feel that this was to keep the Islamic hardliners in good humour.  Worse still, there were big notifications prominently hung right near the Durga idols outlining the different Namaz timings so that the Hindu rituals did not interfere with the Islamic prayers. This was seen as a clear message to the minorities to remain within their limits and on the other hand, signal to the radicals that the government is aware of the sensitivity of the majority pandering to the communalists. It doesn’t stop here. A ruling party MP was shown repeatedly on TV calling upon the puja organisers to maintain the “guidelines” issued by the administration. If the MP was involved in proliferating the “instructions” then complicity of the government or the ruling party in these can’t be ruled out. Hindus in Bangladesh are equally sensitive to their religious responsibilities and such strong-arm tactics certainly doesn’t augur well. Now, the question is what was the idea behind by the administrative agencies to usher in these dampening measures when elections are only three months away?Independent analysts feel that assessment made by the ruling party as well as the agencies indicate that Hindu minority votes may not matter at all in the electoral fray. So, even if the minority groups are slighted, there votes will be inconsequential. On their part, minorities are left with no option but to vote for the ruling Awami League (AL). Having done this calculation, it was perhaps decided that such measures howsoever dampening or unsavoury, could be enforced. In other words, the minority sentiments were not factored.  While discussing these communal issues, it becomes imperative to touch upon the balancing act the AL is treading upon to handle the elections. Hefazat-e-Islam – a perilously communal outfit which is nearly 13 years old, and headquartered in Chittagong, is suspected to be enjoying the blessings of the ruling AL. It was possibly floated to counter another communal and fanatic anti-India and pro-Pakistan body the Jamat-eIslami (JeI) but then, over a period of time it exceeded its agenda and outsmarted its mentors. It was visible by the fact that it set off a trail of communal frenzy and violently targeted the Hindu minority including their property.  Having to deal with its own Frankenstein, the ruling party is now at a loss to deal with Hefazat which has not only doubled up its tentacles and activities but also amassed huge financial reserves to spend on destructive missions. Many belonging to the AL are strongly suspected to be supporting the outfit for political gains.Some who matter in the government are sadly adopting an ostrich- like attitude lest they have to address the challenges. This is certainly detrimental to the minority interests. Meanwhile, some authoritative and knowledgeable quarters claim that the MP from Chittagong 15 constituency, Abu Reza Mohammad Nadwi remains in touch with Jamaat, pro-Pakistan and anti-India elements to garner support from the Islamic hardliners’ bloc to keep them on the right side. In Chittagong, there is one Alamma Fazlullah Foundation which is starkly pro-jamat, antiHindu and significantly has much funding regularly received from the Middle East countries.  Such fundings may be used against the political adversaries specially against the non-fanatics to further the agenda of the Wahabis and the salafis targeting the minority resorting to communal violence. This also emboldens the pro-Pakistan lobby active in Bangladesh who are looking for an opportunity to see that Hasina government is not allowed to triumph in the upcoming elections.  They may not succeed in their blueprint but their agenda remains. The plan needs to be busted now so that elections don’t witness any communal violence and secular interests are not harmed. This is particularly essential in view of the surcharged atmosphere arising out of the Israel-Hamas military confrontation leading to heavy polarization and radicalization of the religious ultras."

Known for roaming Bengal tigers in the Sundarbans, a mangrove and swampland in the delta and the longest natural uninterrupted sea beach in Asia (Cox’s Bazar beach) and the oldest tea garden in the subcontinent, Bangladesh has been a close friend of India since its inception.

India and Bangladesh’s geographical locations complement each other and present an opportunity for both to further develop their connectivity links and economies. India and Bangladesh’s bond stresses far beyond the calculus of strategic consideration, and it is rooted in close people-to-people connectivity. These linkages have been stronger due to sharing of common language, culture, history, and spirituality. During his last visit to Bangladesh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasised celebrating this spiritual connection by visiting two religious sites outside Dhaka— the Joshorershari Temple, an important place of worship for believers in Hinduism, in Shyamnager and the temple of Harichand Thakur in Gopalganj. Further, to promote people-topeople connectivity between India and Bangladesh, a new train called ‘Mitali Express’ connecting Dhaka and New Jalpaiguri was inaugurated. Connectivity has become a priority for India and Bangladesh and the two countries are trying the re-establish the old linkages that got disrupted in the Pakistan era. Unlike the past, the progress of India and Bangladesh cannot be measured with the arithmetic of the announcements made during the visit of the top leadership of the two countries. Contrarily, over the years, the two countries have established a well-structured institutional framework for interactions amongst all the stakeholders which ensures sustained dialogue between the two countries across the year. India and Bangladesh together have established more than 50 institutional mechanisms in a wide range of areas including security, defence, trade and economy, and science and technology. These mechanisms regularly monitor developments and work on resolving issues. Given the growth trajectory of the bilateral relations, the visit of top leaders provides a philosophical direction to the bilateral relationship. For India, which is increasingly trying to ‘Act East’ and put its ‘Neighbourhood First’, Bangladesh as an immediate eastern neighbour, is an important littoral on its eastern seaboard. Presently, the country is also India’s largest trading partner in South Asia. As India tries to indulge in greater cooperation in the South Asian region, to better fulfill its IndoPacific aspirations as well as guard against its apprehensions about China’s encroachment in the region, maintaining favourable ties with Bangladesh is critical for the country. India on the other hand is important for Bangladesh, as leveraging ties with it will enhance its economy as well as help in its socio-economic development. Naturally, both India and Bangladesh have worked to consolidate their partnership for the most part of this half a century old journey. Today, both countries are each other’s closest strategic allies in the South Asian region, and in a joint statement issued in March 2021, they upheld their partnership as a model for bilateral relations for the entire region. During the last financial year, the bilateral trade volume between both the countries was $9.9 billion but the potential is much higher. The issued was discussed by India’s Minister for External Affairs S Jaishankar with Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina as well as Foreign Minister Abdul Momen during his Dhaka visit on April 28. While the declared purpose of Jaishankar’s visit was to hand over in person a letter from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Hasina, inviting her to visit India, regional geopolitics was no doubt an important item on his agenda in Dhaka. Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s offer to India to use the Chittagong Port is a win-win situation for India. Built on the Karnafuli river, 16 km upstream of the sea, it is the busiest port along the coastline of the Bay of Bengal and ranks 67th in the Lloyd’s list of the top 100 busiest container ports in the world. For India, the Chittagong Port is easier to access through proper multimodal connectivity, whilst the Kolkata Port has to be reached via the overland narrow Siliguri corridor, otherwise known as the ‘Chicken’s Neck’. Connecting India’s northeast with the Chittagong Port is thus a cheaper option to not only develop this region and strengthen its linkages with the rest of India but also enhance its connectivity with the neighbouring countries sharing Bangladesh’s border. In 2015, both the countries signed a Coastal Shipping Agreement and a Standard Operating Procedure allowing direct regular shipping between the ports on India’s east coast and Bangladesh’s ports. This helped reduce the delivery time from 25 to seven days and substantial savings. In 2020, Tripura finally got access to the Chittagong Port as it received 100 tonnes of cargo from it at the Akhaura Integrated Check Post, in a trial run. Since then there has been no further development apart from the inauguration of the Maitru Setu in March 2021, connecting Tripura to Chittagong. Today, the port is important for China as one of its gateways into the Indian Ocean. Some international reports have described Chinese investments in the port to be a part of its ‘String of Pearls” strategy against India. At present, China enjoys access to the Chittagong Port, is interested in constructing and operating the Dhaka-Chittagong High-Speed Rail Project, building a 220-kms pipeline, and a single mooring point, facilitating direct offloading of imported oil at the Chittagong refinery. The interest of the two Asian giants in the Chittagong Port is apparent. Bangladesh’s offer to India of using the Chittagong Port is one such diplomatic initiative. It reflects the growing bonhomie in their partnership which the two countries had described in March 2021 as a “model of bilateral ties for the entire region”."
