https://www.siasat.com/bangladesh-embraces-indian-medicos-save-girl-child-campaign-2982568/,Bangladesh embraces Indian medico's 'Save Girl Child' campaign,"Pune: Thousands of people and medicos in Bangladesh last week pledged to join a unique 12-year-old ‘Save Girl Child’ initiative by Pune’s famed gynaecologist Dr. Ganesh Rakh.Dr. Rakh, who was invited for a 10-day long guidance tour to different parts of rural Bangladesh, led processions in several towns and villages with thousands marching and chanting slogans to ‘Save Girl Child’.In the biggest event of its kind, over 10,000 trooped behind Dr. Rakh in villages of Jessore district, carrying banners and placards pledging to ‘Save Girl Child’.The marchers comprised mostly women, and girls in the age group of 20-50. Many men also participated at the remote Hidia village in the Khulna division with people from over two dozen neighbouring villages also enthusiastically joining the procession.“Bangladesh has one of the highest rates of child marriages in the world. This has various health implications for the girls, especially those from the economically weaker sections. Thus, there is a high mortality rate among the girls born there,” Dr. Rakh told IANS on his return from Bangladesh on SaturdayHe said that this was an introductory, pilot project with community involvement and now hundreds of private hospitals and clinics have decided to take up the ‘Save Girl Child’ campaign in Bangladesh.Dr. Rakh was honoured and felicitated in several towns and villages including by the Bangladesh Private Clinic & Diagnostic Owner’s Association (BPCDOA), recognized by the country’s government, and conducted around four dozen big and small events in 10 days, including some at night.BPCDOA President Dr. Muhammad Gaji M. Rahman lauded Dr. Rakh’s efforts in creating the awareness and committed to organise similar programs all over Bangladesh in the coming months.BPCDOA Divisional Council Member Dr. M.D. Tarikul Islam underlined the need “to treat all daughters with equality and dignity like the sons” in order to safeguard their future and ensure social and economic progress.“The girl child is our tomorrow and our future. She is not a burden on the family, since without her, the family, the community, and society cannot flourish or progress,” said senior teacher Tahamina Rubi of Nawly High School in Abhaynagar in Jessore district.At another event, the Allardan Hospital & Diagnostic Centre of Chattogram district and the Fatima Hospital & Diagnostic Centre of Narail district announced that they will also launch the ‘Save Girl Child’ campaign in their districts.Other prominent medicos from various private hospitals like Dr. S.M. Sajjad Rehman, Dr. Kayes Al-Azad and Babul Hasan also declared they would provide concessions to girls in treatment charges.In the Narail programme, medicos and social workers like Bipin Kumar Malik, S.M. Ibrahim Hossain, M.M. Jahangir Alam, S.M. Sirajul Islam and Chintu Biswas were present and spoke on the status of the girl child and steps to protect them. Medicos also announced free diagnostic tests and treatment for girls.Dr. Rakh, 48, launched the ‘Save Girl Child’ (Beti Bachao Jan Andolan or BBJA) modestly at his small Medicare Hospital in Pune on January 3, 2012, in an unprecedented manner – “by waiving off all hospital bills, if a female infant was born”, and no questions asked.The BBJA initiative coincided with the birth anniversary of Savitribai Phule (1831-1897).Initially ridiculed as the ‘Mad Doctor’, Dr. Rakh went on undeterred and from January 2012 to January 2024, the Medicare Hospital has notched over 2,525 free deliveries of baby girls, earning him accolades from across the world.These free-of-cost deliveries were irrespective of the mother or the family’s financial status. Also, free follow-ups and all other medical treatments were provided to the mother and her female baby.His idea caught on soon, and individual doctors and small clinics, followed by big hospitals, joined in triggering a new trend in the country’s health sector.“In the last 12 years, the birth of a female child here to any patient – rich, middle class or poor – is an occasion for a big celebration for us… We do not charge the girl’s parents a single rupee,” said Dr. Rakh.After IANS first highlighted Dr. Rakh’s solitary mission (July 2014), it caught attention around the country and even globally, with invitations pouring into the launch of similar campaigns in the US, Europe, Arabian Gulf, South Asia and Far East countries.“So far, I have managed to conduct the campaign in Canada (2017), Zambia (2018) and Bangladesh (2024). Gradually, I would try to go and launch the humanitarian crusade in other countries as well,” he said.In the past 12 years, the campaign has seen over 500,000 doctors joining the initiative in different ways, and more than 13,000 social, religious and medical organisations, including the famous Ajmer Sharif Dargah, supporting it.Besides, Dr. Rakh has conducted more than 1,000 rallies in India and abroad, and 25 lakh-plus volunteers and commoners working in their own humble ways to take it forward.“Earlier, there was a clamour among parents for ‘Ghar Ka Chirag’, now there is a good tolerance if a ‘Ghar Ki Laxmi’ steps into the homes of people, as indicated by the National Health Survey-5, Phase II, with the male-female ratio improving. But we still have a long way to go…” sighed Dr. Rakh.","Dr. Rakh, who was invited for a 10-day long guidance tour to different parts of rural Bangladesh",None,None,None,Indo-Asian News Service,bangladesh,2024-02-25 12:34:00,2024-02-25 13:04:00

https://www.siasat.com/bangladeshi-nobel-laureate-yunus-charge-sheeted-in-fresh-corruption-case-2969390/,Bangladeshi Nobel laureate Yunus charge-sheeted in fresh corruption case,"Dhaka: Bangladesh’s anti-graft agency on Thursday submitted a charge sheet against Nobel Laureate economist Dr Muhammad Yunus on a fresh corruption charge, days after a court granted him bail in a case for violating labour laws.The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) accused the 83-year-old economist and 13 others of misappropriating around Tk 25.22 crore (approximately USD 2.29 million) of Grameen Telecom Workers’ Profit Participation Fund.Yunus is the chairman of Grameen Telecom –which he founded as a non-profit organisation– while the co-defendants include its directors, managing director and employees’ trade union leaders.“We have filed the charge sheet against him (Yunus) and 13 others before the Metropolitan Senior Special Judge’s Court of Dhaka,” an ACC spokesman told reporters.The court has set March 3 for an indictment hearing of the case.Law Minister Anisul Huq rejected allegations of harassing Yunus, saying the government did not fabricate any false cases against him.“Dr Yunus was warned and advised to prevent these violations, but he ignored them. So, the Labour Department filed a lawsuit,” Huq said. “No one is above the law, and if someone commits a crime, they must face the law,” the minister said.Earlier, ACC Secretary Mahmub Hossain said the proceedings against Yunus were initiated based on complaints against him by the Department of Inspection for Factories and Establishments, and the statutory graft agency filed the charge sheet after a long investigation.Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his anti-poverty campaign, earning Bangladesh the reputation of being the home of microcredit through his Grameen Bank, which he founded in 1983.He faces over 150 other cases, including major corruption charges that could see him jailed for years if found guilty. The economist denies all wrongdoing.Last week, an appeals court granted bail to Yunus, who was sentenced on January 1 to six months in prison for violating the country’s labour laws. The court also agreed to hear an appeal against his sentencing.Thursday’s development came days after more than 241 global leaders, including over 125 Nobel laureates, expressed their concerns over the “continuous judicial harassment and potential jailing” of Yunus in a third open letter to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.Irene Khan, the UN Special Rapporteur for the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression, called the January 1 verdict “a travesty of justice”.Khan said the social activist “who brought honour and pride to the country is being persecuted on frivolous grounds.”“We agree with Irene Khan,” said a letter signed by global leaders, including former US President Barack Obama. The letter said that the verdict was the outcome of “the rushed legal process and lack of consistency about how Bangladesh’s laws are applied.”Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also reacted to the verdict. “Bangladeshis deserve a government that honours and supports — rather than persecutes — its most esteemed citizens,” he said.“I call on the prime minister (Sheikh Hasina) to stop this senseless campaign against Professor Muhammad Yunus now,” he said.Hasina’s Awami League party won a record fourth consecutive term in the general election held on January 7.International rights groups, including Amnesty International, also condemned the verdict while several leading Bangladeshi civil society figures said Yunus was exposed to legal “harassment”.In response to the global leaders’ previous letter, Hasina recently told a news conference that the signatories “should send experts, including lawyers, to go through all the documents of Professor Yunus and his cases to see if there is any wrongdoing or wrongful prosecution.”The global leaders agreed to her proposal in their third letter, published as a full-page advertisement in the Washington Post on Monday.“We accept your invitation . . . (But) this examination should include not only the labour law case whose verdict was delivered on January 1, but also the investigation being conducted by the Anti-Corruption Commission,” read the letter.The previous two letters were issued in March 2023 and August 2023.The prominent economist was in a protracted row with the incumbent government due to obscure reasons.The government led by Hasina launched a series of investigations against him after coming to power in 2008.Many people believe that Hasina became enraged when Yunus announced he would form a political party in 2007 when the country was run by a military-backed government and she was in prison.However, Yunus did not follow through on the plan but criticised politicians in the country, alleging they were only interested in making money.",Court has set March 3 for an indictment hearing of the case.,None,None,None,Press Trust of India,bangladesh,2024-02-01 21:07:00,2024-02-01 21:37:00
https://www.siasat.com/assam-would-have-been-part-of-bangladesh-if-invasions-were-not-thwarted-amit-shah-2960439/,Assam would have been part of Bangladesh if invasions were not thwarted: Amit Shah,"Guwahati: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday said that Assam would have been a part of Bangladesh and not of India if Ahom Commander Lachit Barphukan and other rulers had not thwarted the aggression of the Mughals and other invaders.The main reason why Assam could remain a part of India is that the army of several invaders-from Khilji to Aurangzeb- were defeated and sent back, Shah said here while launching the book ‘Assam’s Braveheart-Lachit Barphukan’.The book is written by eminent author Arup Kumar Dutta in English and has been translated into 23 scheduled languages.“There are many such tales of valour and victory in the country which have not properly evaluated by historians but now they are being given their due recognition so that the next generation gets inspired,” he said.The minister also said, ‘Earlier, history was written and taught to us from the British point of view and there were only passing references of heroes who struggled hard for the ‘swabhiman’ (self-respect) and ‘samman’ (honour) of the country,” he said.The effort of the Assam government in getting the book translated into 23 scheduled languages is indeed laudable and it will serve as a reference book for students and researchers who will know more about him and the history of this part of the country, Shah said.Referring to the title of the book, the minister said that he has no complaints against its content but has reservations about the title, as ‘Lachit is not a braveheart of Assam alone but of the entire country’.He was a commander who led his soldiers from the front, mastered the art of guerilla and river warfare, having perhaps fought the biggest war on the river, and even his arch-rival Ram Singh of the Mughal army had praised him saying that he was yet to fight against a soldier of Lachit’s stature, Shah said.‘Besides, he (Lachit) was known to take people from all communities as his soldiers and the killing of his maternal uncle for laziness along with his famed quote that his uncle was not above the country has gone down in history as exemplary show of courage and bravery,” Shah said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s aim to launch the ‘Azaadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’ was manifold and the primary goal was to raise consciousness as well as awareness about the freedom struggle and also to bring to the fore the struggles of many in different parts of the country who played a pivotal role in ensuring the country’s independence.‘There are many bravehearts and heroes in different parts of the country whose valour is not known outside their states but we are determined to take the stories of their lives to each state so that it inspires the future generation and in the next 25 years, people can help make India a leading country of the world,” Shah said.He urged the youth to raise the collective confidence of the nation so that it can become ‘purna vikshit” (fully developed) and “atma nirbhar” (self-reliant).The union minister further alleged that the Congress had created a “divide among the people of the region” but the prime minister with his policy of development and peace in the North East has ensured that the people gain confidence to take the nation towards the goal of becoming the most developed country in the world.He also appealed to the people that they should rise above the differences of languages and religion for the good of Assam and the North East.‘Language should not be considered as a point of dispute but of strength. We must respect different languages, literature and grammar and make it the strength of the nation’, he said.The publication of the book written in English and translated into 23 languages portrays the strength of the nation and its commitment to honour valour, Shah added.","""Earlier, history was written and taught to us from the British point of view and there were only passing references of heroes who struggled hard for the 'swabhiman' (self-respect) and 'samman' (honour) of the country,"" he said.",None,None,None,Press Trust of India,bangladesh,2024-01-20 21:32:00,2024-01-20 22:02:00

The entire border will have barbed fencing like what we have at the India-Bangladesh border,” he said.“The Indian government is rethinking the free movement agreement with Myanmar. Now, the Government of India is going to stop this facility,” he added.The Free Movement Regime allows people living on both sides of the border to travel 16 km into each other’s territory without a visa. Four Indian states — Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram, share a 1,643-km-long border with Myanmar.Earlier, officials had said that the government was planning to fence a 300-km stretch of the border.More than 31,000 people from Myanmar, mostly from the Chin state, have taken refuge in Mizoram following the military coup in the neighbouring country in February 2021. Many also took shelter in Manipur.Dozens of Myanmar soldiers stationed near the international border with India also fled to Mizoram following intense gunfights with militia group People’s Defence Force (PDF) last year. They were later sent back to their country.Shah also said that there has been a huge change in the law and order of the country under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi during the last 10 years.Attacking the Congress, he alleged that people had to pay bribes to get government jobs during its tenure, and maintained that not a single penny had to be paid for employment under the BJP rule.On the consecration ceremony in Ayodhya, Shah said that Lord Ram would return home after 550 “disrespectful” years.“It’s a matter of pride for the entire India,” he said, noting that it was happening at a time when the country was on course to become a superpower.Congratulating the 2,551 commandos who were inducted into the force at the function, Shah said that the Assam Police has faced challenges such as riots during the Partition, refugee problem, infiltration, the Bangladesh liberation war, insurgency and drug menace.“However, the Assam Police has a rich history of fighting these challenges and winning,” he said.","""The India-Myanmar border will be protected like the Bangladesh border… The Government of India will stop the free movement with Myanmar,"" he said.",None,None,None,Press Trust of India,bangladesh,2024-01-20 19:22:00,2024-01-20 19:52:00

She is among the world’s longest-serving female heads of government.Following the prime minister, the new members of cabinet were sworn in by the president.Hasina’s party won 223 seats in the 300-member Parliament.Opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of ex-prime minister Khaleda Zia boycotted the elections after their demand for a non-party caretaker government to conduct the January 7 polls was rejected.Hasina formed her government for the straight fourth term. She has inducted 25 ministers and 11 state ministers in her Cabinet.“We have not got the (new) ministers and state ministers’ portfolios yet but it is expected to be announced later Thursday,” a cabinet division official told PTI.Hasina has dropped some heavyweights like foreign minister AK Abdul Momen, finance minister AHM Mostafa Kamal, planning minister Abdul Mannan, agriculture minister Abdur Razzak and commerce minister Tipu Munshi from her new Cabinet.Names of 13 junior ministers out of 18 state ministers in the outgoing government also did not appear in the new list and they included junior minister for foreign affairs Shahriar Alam.The new council of ministers list named 14 new faces as full ministers and seven state ministers though some of them were elevated as cabinet ministers.Samanta Lal Sen, a doctor specialized on burn wounds, emerged as a new face in the list of full ministers as a technocrat to the surprise of many as he was never known for political activism.Simin Hossain Rimi, the daughter of the first prime minister of Bangladesh Tazuddin Ahmed, is among the new faces named on the state ministers list.Bangladesh went to polls on Sunday, in which the ruling Awami League headed by Prime Minister Hasina won 223 seats; the Jatiya Party 11 seats; the Workers’ Party, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal and Bangladesh Kalyan Party one seat each; and independent candidates won 61 seats.India, China and Russia congratulated Hasina after her victory.

We also urge all political parties to reject violence,” it said.The State Department added that the US supports the people of Bangladesh and their aspirations for democracy, freedom of peaceful assembly, and freedom of expression.“Looking ahead, the United States remains committed to partnering with Bangladesh to advance our shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific, to supporting human rights and civil society in Bangladesh, and to deepening our people-to-people and economic ties,” it said.UN Human Rights Chief Volker T rk called on Bangladesh’s newly elected government to take steps to renew the country’s commitment to democracy and human rights, voicing distress that the environment for Sunday’s poll was marred by violence and repression of opposition candidates and supporters.“In the months leading up to the vote, thousands of opposition supporters have been detained arbitrarily or subjected to intimidation. Such tactics are not conducive to a truly genuine process,” T rk said.The top UN human rights official noted that democracy was “hard won” in Bangladesh and “must not become cosmetic.”Underlining that Bangladesh has been a role model of development, T rk said he “fervently hopes this will translate into the political and institutional spheres too. The future of all Bangladeshis is at stake.”The UN official noted that mass arrests, threats, enforced disappearances, blackmailing and surveillance were all methods reportedly used by law enforcement officials prior to the ballot, which was boycotted by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Acts of political violence, including arson attacks allegedly committed by opposition groups, have also been reported.Around 25,000 opposition supporters have been arrested, including key party leaders, since October, the UN official said. At least 10 opposition supporters reportedly died or were killed in custody in the last two months, raising serious concerns about possible torture or harsh conditions of detention, the UN Human Rights chief said.He said many human rights defenders have been forced to go into hiding, and some have fled the country, while dozens of suspected enforced disappearance cases have been reported, mostly in November.“These incidents must be independently investigated, and those responsible must be brought to justice in fair and transparent trials,” T rk said. “Violations and irregularities during the campaign and on election day itself should also be thoroughly and effectively investigated.”T rk implored the government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the human rights of all Bangladeshis are fully taken into account, and to strengthen the underpinnings of a truly inclusive democracy in the country.Associate spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Florencia Soto Ni o, in response to a question on whether the UN believes the elections were free and fair, said, “We have seen the situation that’s unfolding there. The Secretary-General continues to follow what’s happening. He notes the opposition’s decision to boycott the elections.”She said the UN chief is “obviously concerned” about reports of incidents of violence prior to, and during the elections. Guterres calls on all parties to reject all forms of violence and to ensure that human rights and the rule of law are fully respected. “This is essential for the consolidation of democracy and economic prosperity there,” she said.In response to another question, she said it is essential that the Bangladesh government fosters an environment of democracy. “Respect and reject all forms of violence, and obviously ensure that human rights are respected there,” she said.Awami League (AL) won 223 seats in the 300-member Parliament on Sunday in the polls boycotted by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the main opposition.The Bangladesh government had invited a large number of foreign observers from India and other countries, as well as multilateral organisations, to observe the elections.","The State Department added that the US supports the people of Bangladesh and their aspirations for democracy, freedom of peaceful assembly, and freedom of expression.",None,None,None,Press Trust of India,bangladesh,2024-01-09 08:29:00,2024-01-09 08:59:00

Hasina won the Gopalganj-3 seat for the eighth time since 1986. She bagged 249,965 votes while her nearest rival M Nizam Uddin Lashkar from the Bangladesh Supreme Party secured just 469 votes, bdnews24 reported. The 76-year-old leader, who has been ruling the strategically located South Asian nation since 2009, is set to secure a record fourth consecutive term and fifth overall term in the one-sided election, which witnessed a low turnout. According to the Daily Star newspaper, Awami League has so far won 17 out of 20 seats in the 300-member parliament. The Jatiya Party won one seat while independents bagged two. Citing unofficial results, the Dhaka Tribune newspaper, however, reported that the Awami League has won in 170 constituencies while the Jatiya Party secured 10 seats. Independent candidates won the race in 45 seats, it added. Awami League General Secretary Obaidul Quader claimed that the people have rejected the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami’s boycott of the election by casting their ballots. “I sincerely thank those who braved the fear of vandalism, arson, and terrorism to participate in the 12th national parliamentary elections,” Quader said. Jatiya Party Chairman GM Quader won the Rangpur-3 seat in the 12th national parliamentary election. According to the initial estimates, the voter turnout was around 40 per cent but the figure could change after the final count, Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal earlier said. The 2018 general election recorded an overall turnout of more than 80 per cent. Former premier Khaleda Zia-led Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) leaders said the party plans to intensify its anti-government movement through a peaceful public engagement programme from Tuesday as it dubbed the polls as “fake.” The BNP boycotted the 2014 election but joined the one in 2018. This time, they boycotted the polls. Fifteen other political parties also boycotted the election. The party leaders claimed that the low turnout was evidence that their boycott movement had been successful. They said that peaceful democratic protest programmes will be accelerated, and the people’s right to vote will be established through this programme. The BNP is observing a 48-hour nationwide general strike which began at 6 am on Saturday and will end at 6 am on Monday. It had called upon voters to shun the election to mark the beginning of an end of what it calls a “fascist government.” Earlier, an election commission spokesman said that other than some sporadic incidents of violence, the voting was largely peaceful in 299 of the 300 constituencies. The Commission suspended polling in one seat because of the death of a candidate. The election commission cancelled the candidature of a ruling Awami League candidate in northeastern Chattogram at the fag-end of the voting hours as he “scolded and threatened” a police officer. The usual election-day fervour was nowhere to be seen. Even in front of the election campaign booths, there was no presence of voters except the ruling party-backed supporters and election agents. Voters cast their votes without any disruption in the absence of long queues, leaving presiding officers with idle time. Shots were fired during a clash between supporters of two candidates running for the Chattogram-10 seat. Two people – Shanto Barua, 24, and Jamal, 35 – were shot and taken to Chattogram Medical College Hospital. Two people were injured after a clash between supporters of the Awami League candidate and an independent candidate at a polling centre in Jamalpur’s Sharishabari. Four persons, including a child, were injured after two crude bombs exploded near a voting centre in Dhaka’s Hazaribagh. Prime Minister Hasina cast her vote at Dhaka City College polling centre soon after the voting started. Her daughter Saima Wazed accompanied her. She alleged that the opposition BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami alliance does not believe in democracy. “People will vote as they wish. And we were able to create that voting environment. Although the BNP-Jamaat alliance has caused many incidents, including arson attacks,” she told reporters. In response to a question, Hasina said that India is a “trusted friend” of Bangladesh. “We are very lucky…India is our trusted friend. During our Liberation War, they supported us not only that after 1975, when we lost our whole family – father, mother, brothers, everyone (in a military coup) – and only we two (Hasina and her younger sister Rehana) survived… they gave us shelter. So, we have our best wishes to the people of India,” she told reporters. In August 1975, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, his wife and their three sons were assassinated in their home by military officers. His daughters Hasina and Rehana survived the purge as they were abroad. In response to a question on how acceptable the election will be while the BNP is boycotting it, Hasina said that her responsibility is towards the people. “Whether people accept this election or not it is important to me. So, I don’t care about their (foreign media) acceptance. No matter what did the terrorist party say or not?” she said. The 27 political parties that contested the elections include the opposition Jatiya Party. The rest are members of the ruling Awami League-led coalition, which experts dub as “satellite parties.” A total of 119.6 million registered voters were eligible to vote at Sunday’s polls in more than 42,000 polling stations, according to the country’s Election Commission. More than 1,500 candidates from 27 political parties were contesting in the election, besides 436 independent candidates. Over 100 foreign observers, including three from India, monitored the 12th general election, which was held under tight security. More than 7.5 lakh members of law enforcement agencies and security forces were deployed to ensure law and order during the polls. Former Election Commissioner Brig Gen (retd) Sakhawat Hussain termed Sunday’s polls a unique one compared to the previous two elections. “This time the election is taking place between candidates from the same party in the name of independents and dummies. As a result, voters are less interested in the polls,” said Sakhawat. “So, it is a unique model election Results of the election are certain, everybody knows who is going to win. The only uncertain thing is who will be in the opposition bench,” he added. On Friday, the UN Special Rapporteur, Clement Nyaletsossi Voule, said he was “deeply disturbed” by the repressive environment surrounding the polls in Bangladesh. ","They said that peaceful democratic protest programmes will be accelerated, and the people's right to vote will be established through this programme.

This achievement has encouraged continued multilateral cooperation and friendly relations with India.”Moreover, earlier on Friday, three members of the Election Commission of India (ECI) arrived in Dhaka ahead of Bangladesh’s 12th general elections. They will actively participate as part of the international election observer team, contributing to the monitoring process.The Election Commission has made thorough arrangements for the upcoming 12th national parliamentary election on January 7 to ensure a peaceful process.As many as 127 foreign observers will track the election process to assess the election’ fairness.International election expert teams from the European Union are present in Dhaka, with foreign observers from various countries, including a Commonwealth team, set to monitor the elections.Despite the preparations, the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has decided to boycott the polls. To prevent voting, the BNP has started a 48-hour strike starting commencing on Saturday to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s “illegal government,” the Dhaka Tribune reported.Under the leadership of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, the BNP has decided to boycott the general election scheduled for Sunday. The party is advocating for the formation of an interim non-party neutral government to oversee the election, a demand that has been rebuffed by the government led by Prime Minister Hasina.The BNP will carry out processions, mass campaigns and distribute leaflets against the polls across the country, as reported by the Dhaka Tribune.Moreover, the second day of the hartal coincides with the election, which has already gathered global attention.Adding to the already existing hurdles, the Bangladesh Election Commission’s election application, “Smart Election Management BD” crashed on the eve of the general elections.The Tk21 crore app, launched by the Election Commission for voters to find election-related details, including polling centre locations, stopped working a day before the polling date.Furthermore, at least 14 polling centres and two schools in 10 districts of Bangladesh were set on fire between Friday evening and early Saturday hours before general elections, as reported by the Dhaka Tribune.However, the general elections in Bangladesh will witness participation from approximately 30 countries and 180 overseas observers, signifying international interest and observation in the electoral process.

Besides, 73 foreign journalists have received accreditations, and among them, 17 have already arrived,” Foreign Secretary Masud Bin Momen told reporters late Thursday.He said the observers will monitor the polls in the capital, Dhaka, and elsewhere in the country.“But we have suggested to them that they choose the destinations having air connectivity (for convenience),” the foreign secretary said. The Commonwealth has sent a 17-member team, the largest among foreign observers.The other poll observers included members from the European Union, the Commonwealth, the US-based International Republican Institute (IRI) and National Democratic Institute (NDI), the South Asia Democratic Forum (SADF), and other reputable organisations.A United Nations spokesperson on Thursday said the UN was “watching the (polls) process closely, and we hope that all the elections happen in a transparent and organised manner” but said the global body did not have any comment on the election boycott by the Opposition.The daylong voting will start simultaneously in 299 parliamentary constituencies across Bangladesh on Sunday. Election in one constituency was postponed after an independent candidate died of natural causes.Some 1,519 candidates from 27 political parties are contesting in the election. Besides, there are 436 independent candidates.A total of 119.6 million registered voters are eligible to vote at Sunday’s polls in more than 42,000 polling stations, according to the election commission.The election commission said it expected the results to start flowing from early on January 8.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s ruling Awami League is expected to win for a straight fourth time as the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of former premier Khaleda Zia, who is effectively under house arrest as a convict of graft charges, boycotted the polls.The polls, however, are contested by 27 political parties, including the parliamentary opposition Jatiya Party (JAPA). The rest are members of the ruling Awami League-led coalition, which experts dub as “satellite parties.”As part of its vote boycott campaign, BNP on Thursday called a 48-hour countrywide general strike from 6 am on January 6 to 6 am on January 8 as the party has been claiming no election under the incumbent government would be fair and credible.BNP spokesman Ruhul Kabir Rizvi announced the stoppage, saying it was aimed to press home their demands for “resignation of the illegal government, establishment of a non-party neutral government and release of all party leaders and activists from prison”.Bangladesh deployed Army troops across the country two days ago “in aid of civil administration” to maintain peace and order during the voting.But according to media reports, unidentified people carried homemade bomb and arson attacks in empty polling centres in four out of 64 administrative districts, while BNP activists clashed with police in another district, leaving five people wounded on Friday.Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal late on Thursday joined a meeting with foreign ambassadors and diplomats, who declined to talk to the media.Brussels-based think-tank International Crisis Group (ICG) said the country is at a critical juncture.“Bangladesh is at a critical juncture. The once vibrant, if imperfect democracy will soon hold a third election without a credible alternative to the incumbent government,” it said in a recent report.The think tank said while it was now too late to delay the January election, the Awami League and BNP should work after the vote to de-escalate the country’s political tensions, including through concessions by both sides.Political science professor and analyst Harunur Rashid said he feared Bangladesh might need to wait for an indefinite period to witness a congenial political atmosphere because of the highly conflicting nature between the two major parties.Awami League General Secretary Obaidul Kader on Friday said there was no perfect democracy anywhere in the world, but BNP’s participation could have made the upcoming elections more competitive.Emerging from a meeting with the Commonwealth Observer Group, Kader said, “They have agreed with us that nowhere in the world there is a cent per cent or perfect democracy”.He said an unprecedented “mass tide” has been created in favour of the party across the country ahead of the elections.Hoping that the 12th national elections would be held in a free, fair, and peaceful manner, he said the election means a festival of democracy to the people of Bangladesh, and this time it is no exception.“Ignoring the severe cold, the people have welcomed the election and taken part in the polls campaign. A mass tide has been created across the country in favour of the boat (the Awami Party’s election symbol),” Kader said.He commented on the BNP’s general strike on election day and said it is now an “obsolete tool” in Bangladesh’s politics.BNP boycotted the 2014 election but joined the one in 2018, which party leaders later said was a mistake, alleging the voting was marred with widespread rigging and intimidation.BNP’s boycott announcement, however, initially posed a challenge to Hasina on the legitimacy of the January 7 polls as JAPA also expressed its reluctance to join the fray but agreed to participate as the ruling party decided to spare them 26 seats, withdrawing their candidates.Awami League also left six seats to its partners in the 14-party ruling alliance while Hasina encouraged independent and rebel candidates to contest to make the polling participatory while the ruling party was carrying out a campaign for high voter turnouts.Senior BNP leader Abdul Moyeen Khan on Friday called the government efforts “childish”, proving its “political bankruptcy”.Analysts and watchdogs, however, said the country of 170 million was heading for virtual one-party rule, while many voters said they found no charm in voting this time as the polling was set to reelect the incumbent government.Meanwhile, the Commonwealth and the Indian election monitoring officials have visited the Media Centre opened for the journalists at the Pan Pacific Sonargoan Hotel in Dhaka.The Press Information Department (PID) runs the centre to provide logistical support to local and foreign journalists for the 12th national parliamentary election to be held on Sunday.Director General (Media) of Election Commission of India B Narayanan and Adviser and Head of Governance and Peace of Electoral Support Section of Commonwealth Secretariat Linford Andrews visited the Centre on Friday, said PID.They interacted with the PID officials during the visit.Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal on Thursday said: “There will be modern facilities available for representatives of domestic and foreign media who will come, stay, and try to collect information.”Journalists will be crucial in highlighting the electoral process’s transparency and visibility, he said.","A total of 119.6 million registered voters are eligible to vote at Sunday's polls in more than 42,000 polling stations, according to the election commission.",None,None,None,Press Trust of India,bangladesh,2024-01-05 20:38:00,2024-01-05 21:08:00

After we came to power, we eradicated them. As long as we (Awami League) are in power, Bangladesh will never allow its territory to be used for any anti-India activity, terrorists, or divisive forces,” he said.Highlighting the close ties developed with India by the Awami League government, Khan claimed that the relations between the two neighbours have always suffered and minorities have faced atrocities whenever the BNP came to power.When asked whether bilateral relations with India would be affected if the Awami League is not in power in Bangladesh, he asserted, “Of course, it will. In the past, we have seen that this has happened.”Discussing Indo-Bangla relations, Khan said, “India has been a friend in need for Bangladesh Our relationship with India is special, and the role it played during the Bangladesh Liberation War has always been lauded by us.”Regarding the “growing closeness” between Dhaka and Beijing, Khan said that the ties between India and Bangladesh cannot be compared with any other relationship.He said, “Our foreign policy is friendship with all and malice to none. So, we have relationships with all countries. China has made investments in power plants, infrastructure, and has engaged in aggressive marketing on the economic front. But the relationship with India is different, and this won’t have any impact on Indo-Bangla relations,” he said.When asked about attacks on Hindus, who are a minority in Bangladesh, the country’s home minister said, “The government has taken stern and prompt action against the miscreants.”He continued, “We believe in secular ideals. We don’t believe in majority or minority. Whenever there has been any atrocity, we have taken stern action against the culprits. The Hindus constitute nearly 10 per cent of the population.”Claiming that the ratio of crime against the Hindus is much less when compared to the overall crime, he said “Unfortunately, those incidents (crimes against Hindus) get highlighted.”Speaking on general elections in Bangladesh, Khan stated that the country will have free and fair elections.“All arrangements have been made to ensure that people can vote freely. The BNP is apprehensive that it will never get a majority in the polls. The party has been losing public support with each passing day,” he said.The Awami League has been in power in Bangladesh since 2008, and the polls are scheduled for January 7.","""India has been a friend in need for Bangladesh Our relationship with India is special, and the role it played during the Bangladesh Liberation War has always been lauded by us,"" Home minister Asaduzzaman Khan said.",None,None,None,Press Trust of India,bangladesh,2024-01-05 14:26:00,2024-01-05 14:56:00

It appears that the allegation has not been barred by limitation either,” said Labour Court judge Sheikh Merina Sultana while pronouncing the judgment.The Third Labor Court judge ruled that 83-year-old Yunus, who was present in the court, would serve six months of simple or non-rigorous imprisonment for violating the law as the Grameen Telecom chairman along with three other executives of the social business company.She also slapped a Taka 25,000 fine on each of them, saying that by default they would have to serve 10 more days in jail.Soon after the verdict, Yunus and three others applied for bail.The judge immediately granted one month’s bail in exchange for a Taka 5,000 bond.Under the law, Yunus and the three others could appeal against the verdict in the High Court.Yunus, whose experiment with poor men’s banking earned Bangladesh the reputation of being the home of microfinance, and three of his colleagues at Grameen Telecom, one of the firms he founded, were accused of violating labor laws when they failed to create a workers’ welfare fund in the company.Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his anti-poverty campaign through the Grameen Bank, a model that was replicated across continents.He has been in a protracted row with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government due to obscure reasons, while authorities began a series of investigations against him after she came to power in 2008.His supporters described the judgment as “politically motivated.”","Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his anti-poverty campaign through the Grameen Bank, a model that was replicated across continents.",None,None,None,Press Trust of India,bangladesh,2024-01-01 16:32:00,2024-01-01 17:02:00

If the State of West Bengal cooperates in acquiring the land and hands over the land for fencing, the central government will do so,” Mehta told the bench, also comprising Justices Surya Kant, M M Sundresh, J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra.The SG explained before the court the steps taken to curb the influx of illegal immigrants, particularly the states in the North-East.The top court, which reserved its order on the petitions challenging the constitutional validity of Section 6A, also heard submissions of senior advocates Shyam Divan and Kapil Sibal.Divan submitted there was no temporal limit to the operation of Section 6A and individuals could still apply for citizenship under it.He said there existed no mechanism for evaluating, assessing, or determining the grant of citizenship under Section 6A(2).The bench reserved order on 17 petitions questioning the constitutional validity of Section 6A, which was inserted into the Citizenship Act as a special provision to deal with the citizenship of people covered under the Assam Accord.It says those who came to Assam on or after January 1, 1966 but before March 25, 1971 from specified territories, including Bangladesh, in accordance with the Citizenship Act amended in 1985, and since then are residents of the northeastern state, must register themselves under Section 18 for acquiring Indian citizenship.As a result, the provision fixes March 25, 1971 as the cut-off date for granting citizenship to migrants, particularly those from Bangladesh, residing in Assam.The Centre has told the court in an affidavit that it is not possible to collect data of illegal migrants living in various parts of the country as entry of foreign nationals is clandestine and surreptitious.It informed the apex court that 17,861 people have been granted citizenship under Section 6A.Answering the court’s query, the Centre said 32,381 foreigners have been detected under the orders of foreigners tribunal with reference to the period 1966-1971.The top court had earlier directed the Centre and the Assam government to provide extensive data, including those on the number of Bangladeshi immigrants granted Indian citizenship in Assam between January 1, 1966 and March 25, 1971, while taking note of pleas that illegal immigration has impacted the demography and cultural fabric of the border state.","Answering the court's query, the Centre said 32,381 foreigners have been detected under the orders of foreigners tribunal with reference to the period 1966-1971.",None,None,None,Press Trust of India,bangladesh,2023-12-12 23:21:00,2023-12-12 23:51:00
