This inauguration marks the first of the five trial movements of cargo vessels between Maia Port in India and Sultanganj, Godagari Port of Call in Bangladesh on Indo Bangladesh Protocol (IBP) Route 5 and 6.There is significant potential for cargo movement through this IBP Route, which is expected to give new impetus to the Inland waterways ecosystem in both countries.Verma said that the re-opening of the Maia-Sultanganj river route is a step that will benefit the local economies on the two sides of the border as well as also contribute to national economies and strengthen sub-regional cooperation and integration.Noting that India was today Bangladesh’s largest export destination in Asia, the High Commissioner hoped that better connectivity links and new measures like trade in Indian Rupee will further enhance Bangladeshi exports to India.Verma said the connectivity landscape between India and Bangladesh has rapidly been changing.“With our contiguous geography and shared history and culture, we are actually re-connecting our two countries,” he added.The High Commissioner said negotiation on the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) between India and Bangladesh is going to start soon.India is the second-largest import source for Bangladesh, trailing only behind China. Dhaka's exports to India reached a total of USD 1990 million in 2021–22, whereas imports from India amounted to a USD 13.69 billion in the same period.In FY23 (until February), Indian exports to Bangladesh tallied at USD 10.63 billion, equivalent to 2.6 per cent of India's total exports. Conversely, Bangladesh's imports from India during the same period totalled USD 1.86 billion, constituting 0.28 per cent of India's overall imports.","High Commissioner Pranay Verma made these remarks on Monday after Shipping Minister Khalid Mahmud Chowdhury inaugurated the Sultanganj port, establishing naval connectivity between Bangladesh’s Rajshahi and India’s Murshidabad.",None,None,None,PTI,bangladesh,2024-02-13 10:19:00,2024-02-13 10:49:00

Former captain Tamim, who had retired from international cricket in July last year, had reversed his decision within 24 hours after Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina asked him to continue. Tamim's decision to quit the game was because of his worsening relationship with the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Nazmul Hassan, who had questioned the left-handed batter's professionalism. BCB's move to leave Tamim out of the central contract list on Monday is an indication he is no longer in their scheme of things for 2024. BCB handed out central contracts to 21 cricketers, out of which Shoriful Islam and new captain Najmul Hossain Shanto got the all-format deals. Right-arm pacer Taskin Ahmed has been dropped from the Test contract after he reportedly opted out. He has, however, retained his ODI and T20I contracts. Besides Tamim, Ebadot Hossain, Afif Hossain and Mosaddek Hossain have also been excluded from the central contracts list. Towhid Hridoy, Tanzim Hasan, Mahmudul Hasan Joy, Naeem Hasan and Nurul Hasan are the new entrants in the central contract. During the meeting, the BCB also approved the salary contracts of 85 first-class cricketers. Central contracts list: 	 All formats: Litton Das, Shakib Al Hasan, Mehidy Hassan Miraz, Najmul Hossain Shanto and Shoriful Islam. Tests and ODIs: Mushfiqur Rahim.

No one knows it better than India's head coach, Sukla Dutta.""I'm truly not pleased that India have been losing to Bangladesh for the past three years, but tomorrow will be the time to change that. I am sure both teams will put in equal efforts, but the team who score first will likely emerge champion, as the confidence to score more will start from there,” she said ahead of the Bangladesh clash.""I understand there will be huge support for Bangladesh, but we'll only concentrate on our own game,"" she added.Having already played against Bangladesh in the group stage, the India head coach knows how to handle the situation.""We know exactly how they play. But there's no doubt they're a good side. I have instructed my players to stay focused on their positions and prioritise man-marking. It's crucial to cover the midfield more effectively because if we disrupt their ball distribution in that area, we can perform even better,"" she said.

The soldiers entered through the Tambru border in predawn hours on Sunday and sought shelter from the Bangladesh Border Guard (BGB).“Fifty-eight BGP personnel took shelter in Bangladesh throughout the day since the predawn hours. Fourteen of them crossed the border with bullet wounds and are being treated at different hospitals, including health facilities in Rohingya camps,” said an official familiar with the development.The official, who preferred anonymity, said the paramilitary soldiers were kept under their counterpart Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) custody in southeastern Cox’s Bazar bordering Myanmar’s Rakhine state while the weapons they carried were deposited in BGB cache.The official said many of the soldiers came to Bangladesh territory in combat uniforms and weapons while others were in their plainclothes leaving their arms back home.“The BGB informed the development to their Myanmar counterparts,” said the official.Dhaka, meanwhile, expressing concern over the skirmishes in its border areas with Myanmar, said the violence was affecting Bangladesh's frontlines.Road Transport Minister and Awami League General Secretary Obaidul Quader sought Chinese intervention to de-escalate the conflict given Beijing’s close contacts with Burmese authorities.“The internal war is their (Myanmar’s) domestic concern. But when the sound of gunfights is heard at the border, naturally it creates panic in the public mind. We, therefore, expect Beijing’s intervention,” Quader told the media after he met with the Chinese envoy.Officials earlier said 14 BGP personnel crossed the border in predawn hours through the Ghumdhum border while a BGB spokesman in Dhaka thereafter asked journalists to await a media briefing on the development.No official briefing was however done until Sunday evening.District administration of Bandarban, where the troubled frontier is located, closed five schools for security reasons fearing mortar shells or stray bullets will slide into the Bangladesh territory as the gunfights are underway on the other side of the border.The BGB asked residents to stay indoors or move cautiously.Officials said reports from the other side of the border suggested army helicopters were strafing on rebel fighters, escalating concerns of massive casualties.Residents in frontier villages, including local Union Parishad members, said sounds of gunfights on the Myanmar side of the border on Saturday night and Sunday panicked residents in villages in the frontier.A BSS report said the skirmishes between the government troops and the rebel Arakan Army frightened residents in several frontier Bangladesh villages as many mortar shells and bullets landed at the Bangladeshi side in the past few days though no casualty was reported so far.“In two such latest incidents on Saturday night a bullet smashed the windshield of a battery-run three-wheeler and a mortar shell hit a village house at Tombru area of Ghumdhum but no one was wounded,” a member of the local union council, the lowest local government-tier, told reporters.Bangladesh earlier ordered an extra security vigil on the border with Myanmar given the gunfights between the military and the insurgent Arakan Army, which is active in the bordering Rakhine region of the country.International media reports suggested several more insurgent groups, some forming alliances among themselves, are confronting the military in several parts of Myanmar.    According to reports and analysts, the resistance movement in Myanmar gained momentum three years after a coup ended a short-lived experiment with democracy.Bangladesh’s border with Myanmar stretches 271.0 kilometres (168.4 miles) from the tri-point with India in the north to the Bay of Bengal in the south.Bangladesh played a critical role in sheltering over a million Muslim minority Rohingyas who fled their home in Rakhine and took refuge in Bangladesh to evade persecution, particularly after a 2017 army crackdown but the current crisis has little to do with the Rohingyas.Bangladesh won praises for the handling of the world’s biggest refugee crisis while Dhaka repeatedly sought their repatriation to their homeland in Rakhine saying the Rohingyas were causing economic, social, security and environmental problems.The issue is now the subject of a United Nations genocide investigation at the International Court of Justice.",An official said many of the soldiers came to Bangladesh territory in combat uniforms and weapons while others were in their plainclothes leaving their arms back home.,None,None,None,PTI,bangladesh,2024-02-04 10:22:00,2024-02-04 10:52:00

She also participated in the 13th Summer Davos Forum in Dalian. During the visit, Hasina called on Chinese President Xi Jinping.""China reiterated its position to further strengthen the bilateral relations during the tenure of the new government in Bangladesh,"" the foreign ministry, meanwhile said in a statement after the envoy met with the minister.Soon after the January 7 polls, Chinese President Xi congratulated Hasina and expressed confidence in boosting the bilateral ties.Bangladesh foreign ministry officials said China wanted Hasina to visit China in September last year but the election and other engagements prevented her from visiting at that time.China’s invitation came shortly after the ruling party’s general secretary and Road Transport Minister Obaidul Quader said India stood beside Bangladesh when BNP tried to foil the polls.""There is no reason for our relations with India to be strained,"" Quader told reporters after Indian High Commissioner in Dhaka Pranay Kumar Verma called on him.Quader said he believed “the wall of confusion and mistrust was finally smashed by Hasina and her Indian counterpart Narendra Modi'.A senior foreign ministry official preferring anonymity said Dhaka would continue to strike a balance in the relationship both with India and China as “we need them both for our stability and development”.According to analysts, Hasina deserved credit for skillfully negotiating the rival interests of India and China as Bangladesh is virtually sandwiched between the two feuding Asian giants. She also received the support of the big neighbours and Russia ahead of the elections.India called the Bangladesh election an “internal matter” and Beijing spoke in the same tone while the Western powers, including the United States have called for credible polls.","'There is no reason for our relations with India to be strained,' Quader told reporters after Indian High Commissioner in Dhaka Pranay Kumar Verma called on him.",None,None,None,PTI,bangladesh,2024-01-29 16:05:00,2024-01-29 16:35:00

Let us see what they do,” Huq told PTI.Elections, however, were held in 299 seats as the natural death of a candidate during electioneering forced the suspension of polls in one constituency.","Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League won 223 seats while JAPA won in 11 constituencies in the January 7 general elections, boycotted by major opposition BNP, while independent candidates bagged 62.",None,None,None,PTI,bangladesh,2024-01-28 16:48:00,2024-01-28 17:18:00

We must respect different languages, literature and grammar and make it the strength of the nation'', he said.The publication of the book written in English and translated into 23 languages portrays the strength of the nation and its commitment to honour valour, Shah added.",Shah further alleged that the Congress had created a 'divide among the people of the region',None,None,None,PTI,bangladesh,2024-01-20 16:54:00,2024-01-20 17:24:00

Mahmud expected New Delhi’s continued support for its next-door neighbour and emphasised expanding the ties through greater connectivity, business, digital economy and people-to-people contact. Major opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of ex-prime minister Khaleda Zia boycotted the January 7 polls saying that no election under Hasina’s government would be fair and credible. The BNP had demanded the polls-time non-party caretaker government for election oversight. The Western powers, including the United States, earlier called for credible and inclusive polls and after the January 7 election they agreed to continue bilateral relations but expressed their reservation about the voting saying it was not free and fair. The US State Department said Washington was concerned by reports of vote irregularities and condemned violence that took place. The US State Department added: “The United States shares the view with other observers that these elections were not free or fair and we regret that not all parties participated.' 	 The UK said: “Democratic elections depend on credible, open, and fair competitions (and) respect for human rights, rule of law and due process are essential elements of the democratic process."" 	 “These standards were not consistently met during the election period. We are concerned at the significant number of arrests of opposition party members before polling day,” the UK statement said.India earlier called the Bangladesh election an “internal matter” while it was one of the first countries to welcome Hasina’s new government when Prime Minister Narendra Modi telephoned Hasina to congratulate on her historic election victory.Modi told Hasina that New Delhi was committed to further strengthening the partnership with Bangladesh in different sectors.Bangladesh’s new government also drew congratulations from China, Russia and almost all Middle Eastern nations including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and Iran.In her first media appearance, Hasina also called India a “great friend”, recalling that it stood by Bangladesh in its 1971 Liberation War, and sheltered her following the 1975 assassination of her father and country’s founder Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. “We had some bilateral issues with India, but solved them across the table ... (I) expect to resolve the rest as well,” she said.Mahmud said he received an invitation from his Indian counterpart Dr. S Jaishankar and expected New Delhi to be his first destination for a bilateral visit at a convenient time.He, however, is set to visit Uganda to join the Non-Aligned Movement Summit, a multilateral event, this week.A foreign ministry statement, meanwhile, said during the meeting Mahmud expressed satisfaction with the existing bilateral relations between the two closest neighbours and hoped to work closely with India in the coming days. “He (Mahmud) emphasised the working on the renewal of the Ganges Water Sharing Treaty, which will expire in 2026. He also emphasised on resolving the pending issues amicably,” read the statement. The Indian envoy congratulated the foreign minister and termed 2023 as one of the most successful years in Dhaka-Delhi ties citing several notable achievements like the inauguration of a few projects related to connectivity and power. Talking to reporters after he met with the foreign minister, Verma said New Delhi eyes on gaining a 'greater momentum' in the existing excellent India-Bangladesh bilateral ties.""We (India) are very hopeful and confident that in the next new term of this (Bangladesh) government, we will be able to achieve even greater momentum in our bilateral partnership,"" he said.""We have always said that India always stands ready to help the people of Bangladesh, to work with the people of the country in realising their vision for a stable, progressive and prosperous society guided by our long-standing friendship and inspired by our shared sacrifice in the Liberation War,"" the envoy said.

He added that the 'path' doubles up as a nursery.Villagers of Kadipur in Nadia have been engaged in different works such as planting and watering the fruit-bearing and aromatic medicinal plants, and digging pits to extend the hedge, as part of the first phase of the project.	  	An official of the Border Security Force (BSF) said 40 bee boxes have been fixed on poles of the metal fence over the last two months with the help of the National Medicinal Plants Board (NMPB).The board, which comes under the Union AYUSH Ministry, has committed its resources of experts, manpower and plants for the 'unique initiative', the official said and added that more bee boxes have reached the area and these are being installed.The bees in the hives, the BSF feels, will act as a deterrent to cross-border criminals and smugglers who come closer or dare to cut the fence and breach it for smuggling cattle, narcotics, gold, silver and other items.Experts and officials from various central and state government departments are engaged in the project.Tulsi, Ekangi, Satmuli, Ashwagandha and Aloe Vera are among the plants that will make the hedge. More saplings, around 60,000, are in the process of being sent to the area by the NMPB and the AYUSH ministry, the AYUSH department official said.On creation of employment, the official said through this project, locals can earn through apiculture and horticulture.Commanding Officer (CO) of the BSF's 32nd Battalion, Sujeet Kumar, who devised the initiative, said the enthusiasm of locals and authorities towards the project is unparalleled.""We thought of adding this new dimension of work under the Vibrant Village Programme, which was envisaged by the prime minister, and the BSF wishes to improve the living standards of the people residing in the border area through beekeeping and cultivation of medicinal plants, and using bees for border security work,"" he said.""We are getting good help from the AYUSH ministry and from a local expert in beekeeping works.

https://www.deccanherald.com//opinion/bangladesh-votes-for-continuity-it-needs-change-2844252,Bangladesh votes for continuity. It needs change,"By Mihir SharmaThe results of Bangladesh’s election last weekend were pre-ordained: Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s party, the Awami League, won for the fourth consecutive time. Hasina, already the world’s longest-serving female head of government, will now embark on another five-year term.The League’s pitch to voters was simple: The party had helped the country post impressive growth numbers and should be allowed to keep doing so. Its victory was overwhelming. Sheikh Hasina should not, however, take that as a mandate to continue with business as usual. For one thing, turnout in the elections was only 40 per cent, suggesting a large proportion of the electorate responded to calls by the country’s main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, to boycott the vote. The BNP wanted elections to be conducted under an independent caretaker administration; instead, the Awami League stayed in office. The US State Department said this week that it agrees with the opposition that “these elections were not free or fair.” The UK also expressed concern over the arrest of opposition members ahead of the vote.Several of Bangladesh’s regional partners — especially India and Japan — believe continuity in Dhaka is a good thing. India worries that the BNP is too soft on Islamists, and Japan believes that Bangladesh under Sheikh Hasina will be a firm partner in Tokyo’s efforts to forge a new, Asia-centric security framework to counter China.But the US is Bangladesh’s largest trading partner, and it would be bad news for the country if its relationship with West broke down over human-rights concerns. Trade sanctions could devastate its export-dependent economy.Even without them, Bangladesh ought to be urgently rethinking its growth model. To date, the country has carefully followed the advice given by every mainstream development economist: Small developing countries should concentrate on increasing exports to the rich world. Decades ago, Dhaka’s policy makers decided to focus on the ready-made garments trade. They succeeded: The country of 170 million people is now the world’s second-largest clothing exporter, behind only China.It hasn’t always been easy. In 2013, over 1,110 people died when an eight-story building called Rana Plaza collapsed. It was home to multiple small garment factories making clothes for brands such as Primark and Zara. There was outrage, at home and abroad, that workers were toiling away in unsafe conditions.The government had to respond swiftly. Together with major brands and trade unions, it signed an “accord on fire and building safety” — called the Bangladesh Accord — committing to more regular inspections and giving workers a larger voice in safety complaints.Today, Bangladesh faces a problem generated by its own success. The garments sector has become so efficient and profitable that it soaks up all of Dhaka’s policy attention, as well as all of the country’s spare capital and entrepreneurial energy. As a result, Bangladesh’s exports are perilously imbalanced. According to the country’s central bank, the garments sector was responsible for 85.9 per cent of the country’s export earnings between October and December of 2022. And nine countries — the US, UK, Canada, and five large European economies — accounted for more than 70 per cent of those exports.That dependency renders the country vulnerable to more than sanctions. Bangladesh has for years been the top beneficiary of the various exceptions to tariffs and intellectual property requirements granted to the world’s “least developed” countries: Nearly three-quarters of its exports take advantage of one or another special exemption. The country is due to graduate from LDC status in 2026 and could lose those privileges.Before then, the new government must figure out how to lock in tariff-free access to the country’s main export markets, ideally through signing various free-trade agreements. Trade pacts with markets in its own region — particularly the economies of Southeast Asia — also ought to be a priority. Bangladesh is one of the least regionally integrated economies in the world. Although three-quarters of its merchandise imports come from Asia, only 16 per cent of its exports are sold back to the region.Even more importantly, Bangladesh will need to work harder to develop new export industries, from pharmaceuticals to software services. While it has the human capital and technical prowess to sustain these sectors, they haven’t yet taken off.Partly that’s because the Awami League’s long tenure has created strong domestic interest groups and incumbent firms with no interest in altering the status quo. A more modern policy mix — one that broadens access to capital and encourages innovation — isn’t what these entrenched interests want to see. If Sheikh Hasina really wants her country to remain a success, she will need to seek out new supporters.",The League’s pitch to voters was simple: The party had helped the country post impressive growth numbers and should be allowed to keep doing so. ,None,None,None,Bloomberg Opinion,bangladesh,2024-01-11 06:17:00,2024-01-11 06:47:00
