Sahinur Islam, a 26-year-old involved in illegal cattle­ trading, died in a conflict with Border Security Force­ (BSF) officers. This happened during a usual patrol which was se­t up to stop unlawful dealings in this area.Sahinur came from the­ Kukurmara village within South Salmara Mankachar district. He was the main pe­rson involved in this incident. As the BSF trie­d to stop a group moving cattle across the border, the­ clash started. Reports suggest Sahinur and othe­rs didn't give up easily when face­d with the BSF. This resulted in a clash with the­ BSF officers on patrol.Things got so heated that the­ BSF officers were attacke­d. They had to fight back using gunfire to protect the­mselves. The gunfire­ happened during the night in Kukurmara. The­ border area betwe­en Indo-Bangladesh became­ very tense. Sahinur suffe­red injuries in this fight which eve­ntually caused his death.After the­ event, the top-ranking officials from Mankachar police and BSF came quickly to the­ site. The Mankachar police took ove­r the case to find out exactly what cause­d the clash and resulted in a de­ath. Authorities will likely check all the­ details before the­ clash happens. They aim to find out if the­ BSF had the right to use firepowe­r in this situation.Illegal cow smuggling across the border betwe­en India and Bangladesh is an ongoing problem. Se­curity teams work hard to stop these activitie­s. The recent conflict shows the­ tough tasks law enforcement tackle­s to keep the borde­r safe and stop illegal activities. As more­ light is shed on the situation, it's likely to le­ad to a detailed look at border control actions. It will also highlight the­ fine line betwe­en keeping se­curity tight and limiting possible harm in such uncertain circumstances.","Sahinur Islam, a 26-year-old cattle smuggler, met his demise in a clash with BSF personnel during a border patrolling operation in Kukurmara.",None,None,None,Sentinel Digital Desk,bangladesh,2024-02-22 01:58:00,2024-02-22 02:28:00
https://www.sentinelassam.com/more-news/international/bangladesh-islami-front-calls-for-closer-delhi-dhaka-relations,Bangladesh Islami Front calls for closer Delhi-Dhaka relations,"New Delhi: Bangladesh’s far right political party Bangladesh Islami Front has completely rejected a recent ‘India Out’ social media campaign in Bangladesh. The campaign has sharpened after Sheikh Hasina, who is seen to be close to India, won a record fourth term in the recently concluded national elections.SUM Abdus Samad, the Secretary General of the Bangladesh Islami Front on Tuesday hit out at the online campaign especially saying it was driven by hard-line elements who spread hate and misinformation. The Islami front is a small independent party which had put up 37 candidates in the recently concluded polls.In an interview to ANI during his visit to New Delhi, Abdus Samad said cordial ties are crucial for both the neighbouring countries as he highlighted the increased connectivity in recent years. “There is misinformation there since the beginning that India brought a lot of stuff from Bangladesh in 1971 and also did brutal acts. This kind of misinformation is there. So it is a must for India to show that we are not against Bangladesh, but we are friends”, said Samad.In Bangladesh, an “India Out” campaign has sparked off on social media. Led by medical professional Pinaki Bhattacharya, who describes himself as an exiled blogger, online activist and human rights defender, the campaign called for the boycott of Indian goods following the results of the elections.Bhattacharya’s social media followers, which number about 53000 on X and 6000 on Instagram, claim that the movement is fuelled by the Indian government’s unilateral support for Sheikh Hasina’s administration in Bangladesh. The bloggers allege that the elections in Bangladesh were neither free nor fair.Bloggers running this campaign have been using three hashtags: #Indiaout #BoycottIndia and #BoycottIndianproducts. A report by Digital Forensics and Research and Analytics Centre reveals that the trend of boycotts on social media does not appear natural.“A closer examination of this trend reveals that the group that began this campaign has always been engaged in anti-India activities in Bangladesh. Several users among them, are either indirectly associated with the political parties of Bangladesh (mainly BNP), or claim to be their supporters”, said the DFRAC report.D-FRAC is a non-partisan and independent media organisation which focuses on fact-checking and identifying hate speech.S U M Abdus Samad reiterated that this was just misinformation being spread, and that Bangladesh has been witnessing rapid growth and development for several years under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.Abdus Samad praised Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and said, “Since the Sheikh Hasina government came into power, there has been a growth in Bangladesh’s development. In 10-20 years, the development in Dhaka, Chittagong which we see now – if one knows about the suffering before – seeing it presently, it won’t be recognizable now”.The Secretary General of the Bangladesh Islami Front also stressed on the continuous improvement in people to people contact and connectivity between India and Bangladesh.“There is now train connectivity from Akhaura… Akhaura- Brahmanbaria. Trade is also happening from river fronts to Assam and Tripura. The connectivity has increased. Items are also being exported and imported to Chittagong port. There is connectivity in Ramgarh as well”, said S U M Abdus Samad.When asked about terrorism and religious fundamentalism in South Asia and Pakistan’s role, Samad emphasized the need for an establishment in Islamabad that does not let terrorism flourish.“Pakistan has no impact in South Asia as such. But there should be a good government there to curb terrorism. There should be a government in Pakistan, which does not let terrorism flourish in South Asia”.He condemned terrorism and religious fundamentalism and said, “Terrorism is against Islam. Killing an innocent has no place in Islam. We are against terrorism. Someone who is a terrorist, cannot be a good Muslim”.The message from the Islami Front leader is clear, the so called ‘India-Out’ campaign appears is confined to a small group online with support of Pro Pakistan political parties like the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist party and smaller radical parties. The campaign is unlikely to affect India-Bangladesh relations which is on solid ground.

https://www.sentinelassam.com/more-news/editorial/stable-bangladesh,Stable Bangladesh,"President Droupadi Murmu has made a very significant statement, describing stability in Bangladesh as of utmost importance for India. The President made this observation when Hasan Mahmud, the visiting Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, called on her at Rashtrapati Bhavan on Friday. This is the first time since Sheikh Hasina assumed office as Prime Minister of Bangladesh that a foreign minister, or, for that matter, any dignitary from the neighbouring country, has visited India. It is a fact that political stability in Bangladesh affects India positively on various accounts. While it is imperative that India’s neighbours enjoy political stability, the importance of Bangladesh has increased in the context of the Northeastern region. Bangladesh and India share a 4,096-kilometre-long international border, the fifth-longest land border in the world. This includes 1879 km with four Northeastern states and 2217 km with West Bengal. Of the four northeastern states, Assam shares 262 km with Bangladesh, Tripura (856 km), Mizoram (318 km), and Meghalaya (443 km). Bangladesh and the Northeastern are, in fact, much more than next-door neighbours. Being geographically contiguous, they are ‘natural markets’ for each other. India and Bangladesh are now working together to widen and strengthen their cooperation. In the field of security, on the other hand, the two sides have made significant progress in recent years. It is time that Bangladesh and India’s Northeast could build on that foundation of cooperation and remove the bottlenecks affecting improved trade and connectivity. While India can help develop Bangladesh’s export and investment climate, Bangladesh can let India use its infrastructure for surface and maritime connectivity to move men and material to the Northeastern region. Equally important is the need to remove tariff and non-tariff barriers, develop and modernise the infrastructure along the border, and facilitate connectivity bilaterally and within the sub-region and beyond. That is exactly why President Droupadi Murmu has noted with satisfaction the progress India and Bangladesh have made in almost all spheres of bilateral cooperation, such as border and security, trade, connectivity, power, infrastructure, people-to-people contacts, etc. It is worth taking note that in the recent few years, both sides have been reviving rail, road, and waterways that traditionally linked the people and economies on both sides and are also simultaneously creating new connectivity links. With several more trans-border connectivity projects becoming reality, it is also time now to take the issues of India-Bangladesh bilateral cooperation to academia and the young generation across the Northeast in particular and the country in general.","President Droupadi Murmu has made a very significant statement, describing stability in Bangladesh as of utmost importance for India.

The BSF has reported the heightened susceptibility of the area to the smuggling of cattle, betel nut, dry fish, biri, cigarettes, chai/patti, and drugs.According to Baranwal, the BSF has observed a significant gathering of smugglers and anti-national elements near the international border during nighttime hours. This gathering poses a substantial risk as individuals attempt to smuggle goods both from India to Bangladesh and vice versa. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the potential infiltration of members of various terrorist outfits and Rohingyas from Myanmar, who have been denied refugee status by India.The imposition of Section 144 comes in the wake of a recent brutal murder in the region. On January 6, Chiang Dkhar, a 50-year-old resident of Umkiang, lost his life in an attack by Bangladeshi miscreants in a betel nut plantation in Lumsoski, located just a few kilometers from Umkiang. The incident underscores the urgency of addressing the challenges posed by smuggling and unauthorized border activities, prompting the local administration to take decisive action to safeguard the region's security and integrity.As the prohibitory orders come into effect, the East Jaintia Hills administration, in collaboration with the BSF, aims to disrupt the networks involved in smuggling and trans-border crimes while ensuring the safety and security of the region's residents.","Prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC have been enforced in East Jaintia Hills to combat widespread smuggling, restricting movement near the Indo-Bangladesh border from 6 pm to 5 am.

The alleged training is being conducted in the Lunglei and Mamit districts, posing potential security implications for the northeastern state.The Jana Sangati Samatee (JSS), led by Santu Larma, is identified as the rebel group involved in these activities. According to PAMRA, the Chakma rebels, primarily based in Bangladesh's Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), are actively engaged in military training across several locations in Mizoram.In Lunglei district, training camps are said to be established in Psalms, Tara Banya, Chumochumi, Malchari (family quarters of JSS Shanti Bahini cadres), Bhalukkyachari, and Andar Manek Village. Additionally, two active camps reportedly operate in Mamit district—Silsury Village under Company Commander Alo Chakma and another under Commander Binanda Chakma.Expressing grave concerns, PAMRA emphasizes the potential threats to Mizoram's security and the safety of its residents. The association urges the state government to take immediate action to halt the alleged training activities and repatriate the Chakma militants.It is noteworthy that PAMRA itself is a former militant group that relinquished arms after the Peace Accord signed in 1986. The accord paved the way for the formation of the Peace Accord MNF Returnees' Association, focusing on the state's integration into the Indian Union.The Chakma conflict in Bangladesh is deeply rooted in religious and ethnic tensions, exacerbated by the country's Islamisation policy. Seeking refuge in neighboring regions, including India, the Chakma refugees' presence has now raised concerns about the potential spillover of conflict into Mizoram. This strife has led to the displacement of Chakmas, who have sought refuge in neighboring regions, including India.As tensions rise, PAMRA warns of potential actions against the training camps if immediate measures are not taken by the Mizoram state government, highlighting the urgency of addressing this security challenge.","
