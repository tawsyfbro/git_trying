https://www.morungexpress.com/from-asia-to-africa-vishwaguru-india-plays-a-key-role-in-growth-of-global-south,"From Asia to Africa, 'Vishwaguru' India plays a key role in growth of Global South","In yet another proof of its emergence as an emphatic voice of the Global South, India joined hands with ""valued friend"" Mauritius once again to strengthen its maritime security and foster socio-economic development.Along with six other community development projects, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Indian-origin Mauritius counterpart Pravind Jugnauth inaugurated a new airstrip and a jetty in Agalega Island on Thursday -- a move seen as an attempt to ensure security, prosperity, and stability in the Indian Ocean Region.The development was seen as a reaffirmation of the Modi government's focus on 'sabka saath, sabka vikas' as a hallmark of India's foreign policy. It goes without saying that PM Modi has been successful in setting the economic agenda aimed at shaping global growth at various international forums.With the oceanic nation being a key partner of India's 'Neighbourhood First Policy' and a special partner under Vision SAGAR, the last 10 years have registered an ""unprecedented momentum"" in the relations between the two countries.India has extended a credit line of $1,000 million along with USD 400 million worth of assistance to the people of Mauritius which underlines the fact that addressing the humanitarian issues is of paramount importance for PM Modi.In addition, New Delhi has contributed profusely to the development of metro rail lines, community development projects, social housing, ENT Hospital, Civil Service College, and sports complexes infrastructures in Mauritius.In what highlights India's greater role in the development of various nations under the visionary leadership of PM Modi, the government has initiated around 600 projects on infrastructure, energy, healthcare, etc, in 78 countries, especially from the Global South.It is these partnerships in the Global South -- from security and health to EEZ -- that spotlights India's role as a ""vishwaguru"", or global teacher, in leading developmental work across third-world countries.With the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war putting the third-world nations under a severe strain, Papua New Guinea PM James Marape, in his address at the Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation in May 2023, urged PM Modi to offer a voice in the face of the Global North.Marape reportedly suggested that the Pacific Island countries would rally behind his voice at global forums even as he praised the Indian PM as the leader of the Global South.India's efforts for these countries were made amply clear during PM Modi's address at the opening session of the 2023 Voice of Global South summit where the leader called for creating a new world order to ensure the welfare of citizens in developing countries.Emphasising that the next phase of global growth will come from countries in the South, PM Modi stressed self-reliance and proposed a four-point global agenda of 'Respond, Recognise, Respect and Reform' at the session.In a bid to remove inequalities, support growth and opportunities, and spread progress and prosperity, the PM -- successfully positioning India as a powerhouse of the 21st century -- urged the developing countries to work towards redesigning political and financial governance globally.Apart from Mauritius, the shining examples of developmental contributions made by India, based on the partner country's priorities, include the recent launch of Unified Payment Interface (UPI) services in Sri Lanka and Mauritius.In a groundbreaking move last year, India and the United Nations launched the 'India-UN Capacity Building Initiative', which aims to share the South Asian nation's development experiences, best practices, and expertise with partner countries in the Global South.In December last year, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) informed the Parliament that India has extended lines of credit 'worth $32.02 billion' for infra projects in Asian and African countries.Responding to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for External Affairs, V. Muraleedharan, said that these funds have supported more than 600 projects in sectors ranging from infrastructure, power, connectivity and health.Providing a breakup of the line of credit amount, Muraleedharan said about $17.06 billion has gone to countries in Asia, $12.15 billion to those in Africa, and $2.81 billion to countries elsewhere.Further, grant assistance projects with countries such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bhutan have also been set up as part of India's 'Neighbourhood First' policy.The parliament was also told that the government is also offering capacity-building assistance to its partners in the Global South under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme (ITEC).""Around 160 countries benefit from these scholarships every year. More than 14,000 training slots are available annually for civilian and defence courses,"" V. Muraleedharan had said.Via ITEC, India has helped countries like Afghanistan, Lithuania, Maldives, Nepal, etc, and scholarships were also announced for Pacific Island Countries in May last year.New Delhi, March 2",None,None,None,None,IANS,bangladesh,2024-03-02,2024-03-02
https://www.morungexpress.com/nagaland-coal-revenue-plummets-rs-6-crore-shortfall-from-last-fiscal,Nagaland coal revenue plummets: Rs 6 crore shortfall from last fiscal,"Kohima | March 1The revenue generated from coal mining in the state during the fiscal year 2023-2024 was Rs 34, 142, 645 crore, compared to Rs 9, 91, 82, 730 crore in 2022-2023. This indicates a significant plummet to a tune of Rs 6, 50, 40, 085 crore.MLA Achumbemo Kikon raised concerns about this massive revenue deficit, stating that the revenue should have increased from one fiscal year to the next, but instead, there has been a decrease, resulting in a significant loss for the government.Deputy Chief Minister TR Zeliang, speaking on behalf of the Chief Minister, explained that the state has been producing coal for many years, but has struggled to fetch a good price in the market due to high sulphur and ash content, despite having high calorific value. Additionally, he said the issue of varying royalty collection is still ongoing and that the exact gap amount of royalty collected during the year will be known by the end of March 31.Clarifying on the revenue deficit, Zeliang said in 2022-2023, there was a sudden demand for coal in the energy sector due to limited imports imposed by the Ministry of Coal, Government of India, resulting in an increase in demand for domestic coal, including Nagaland coal, and consequently, an increase in revenue. However, in the fiscal year 2023-2024, the coal demand in the domestic market decreased due to adequate coal stock made by various energy sectors in the previous season.Furthermore, he maintained that the recent general election held in Bangladesh in January 2024 and the limited quantity of coal imported from Indonesia and the USA at cheaper rates have also impacted the demand for Nagaland coal in the domestic market. Bangladesh, he informed is one of the major consumer of Nagaland coal.Hence, Zeliang justified that the demand and supply of Nagaland coal have been affected. However, he expressed optimism that the market, both domestic and export, will be more conducive in the coming months.Meanwhile, Kikon expressed concern on the implications, including revenue loss, environmental effects, and the destruction of flora and fauna due to coal mining. He highlighted the lack of scientific knowledge and methods of coal mining in the state, with random mining practices leaving the land barren.Kikon also mentioned the high incidence of cancer among residents in the Tamlu area, which he believes is linked to improper mining practices, and calls for stringent regulations and stronger criteria for obtaining mining licenses.Supporting Zeliang’s argument, Minister Temjen Imna Along chipped in that coal rates are very low, with a surplus of coal in stock that cannot be sold for more than Rs 4500 per metric tonne currently.At the same time, he suggested on the establishment of government-authorized depots in each area to regulate the coal market effectively, and that coal mining licenses are only issued to individuals with a substantial capital of about Rs 4-5 crore in their accounts stating that some non-residents are not paying the GST incurring huge loss to local license holders.Along also emphasized on the need for capacity building by the department to educate the local population about coal mining practices and suggested for streamlining revenue generation to ensure the state receives Rs 50-100 crore from mining activities.High incidence of cancer in Tamlu area due to improper mining practices, says Kikon",None,None,None,None,Morung Express News,bangladesh,2024-03-01,2024-03-01

Contracts were denied to players like Iyer and Ishan Kishan, while Hardik was placed in the Grade A category.Hardik suffered an ankle injury during the ODI World Cup 2023 in the match against Bangladesh in Pune in October and the all-rounder has been out of action ever since. Fans on social media also pointed out Pandya’s unavailability from domestic cricket regularly.However, Aakash Chopra defended the BCCI's decision and reckoned that Hardik cannot be punished for not playing first-class cricket, given he has not been contesting for a spot in India's Test squad.""Hardik Pandya's case is very simple. Why would you punish him if he has not made a mistake? He is not playing red-ball cricket. That ambition or aspiration does not exist anymore. He has not said that as such, but the truth is that he is not available at all for any Test series,"" Chopra said on his YouTube Channel.""So if you are not at all auditioning for Tests, no one will ask you to play first-class cricket. Why would you play four-day games when you don't have that much strength in your body to bowl so many overs and have injury problems? So why should he play - fair play,"" Chopra added.Chopra also emphasised the unavailability of Hardik Pandya’s unavailability from domestic and international cricket and explained that the all-round player never missed a game like Ishan Kishan and Shreyas Iyer, therefore Hardik's situation cannot be compared to Kishan and Iyer's.""Let's try to understand the chronology slightly. It will just clear up your mind why a different rule has been kept for him and why it is wrong to include him with Ishan and Shreyas. He got injured during the World Cup, that was October-November,"" Chopra explained.""The Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy was over in October-November. He was playing in the World Cup for India at that time. The last match that Baroda played in the Vijay Hazare Trophy was on 5th December. He was not fit and available.

Now, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) could notify the CAA rules any time before MCC comes into effect.The CAA amends the Citizenship Act of 1955 to provide Indian citizenship to migrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who belong to Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Parsi, Buddhist, and Christian communities and had entered India on or before December 31, 2014, due to religious persecution in their home countries. The CAA will help refugees from these neighbouring countries, who don't have documents.Sources further said that an online portal is ready for registrations.In what is seen as a precursor to CAA, powers have already been given to the district authorities to issue long-term visas, sources said.Over 30 district magistrates and home secretaries of nine states were given powers to grant Indian citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians coming from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan under the Citizenship Act, 1955.The CAA was enacted by the Parliament on December 11, 2019.

It also boosted the Modi (Prime Minister Narendra Modi) government’s ‘Act East’ policy,” he told the media.Addressing the gathering Lalhmachhuana said that Mizo people are strongly opposed to both the fencing and the scrapping of FMR, which enables people on either side of the border to travel 16 km into each other's territory without a passport and visa.The NGOCC Chairman observed that the proposed fencing alone would not curb the problems of smuggling of various drugs and arms besides infiltration.""Despite fencing, smuggling and infiltration through the India-Bangladesh border did not stop,"" he remarked and urged the Union government to find an alternative wayout to solve the border problem.Referring to Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren Singh’s support to both fencing and scrapping the FMR, Lalhmachhuana said they have no problem if the Manipur government agrees to the fencing along its border with Myanmar.Lone Rajya Sabha member from Mizoram and senior Mizo National Front (MNF) leader K Vanlalvena and several MLAs from the ruling Zoram People's Movement (ZPM) and opposition parties, who stepped out of the ongoing budget session of the Assembly during the recess, took part in the protest demonstration.Vanlalvena, in a letter to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, had said that the erstwhile British government after arbitrarily demarcating the international border with Mizoram forcibly settled Mizo people in three countries -- India, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), and Burma (now Myanmar).Some leaders of Myanmar, who took shelter in Mizoram, also attended the protest event.Earlier, the NGOCC had sent a memorandum to Union Home Minister Amit Shah urging him to reconsider the decision to scrap the FMR and fence the India-Myanmar border.Chief Minister Lalduhoma, who earlier met Prime Minister, Union Home Minister and External Affairs Minister S.

An update received here stated that during the book launch event, the panelists were former ambassador to Myanmar Rajiv Bhatia and Maj Gen (Retd) Dipankar Banerjee, who was also a consultant to the UN. The event was moderated by Gaurav Choudhury, CEO of Earshot DigiMedia.‘ULFA: The Mirage of Dawn’ “is the untold story of the outlawed separatist outfit, the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), from its inception in the early 1980s in the backdrop of the historic Assam Movement, to the present when a peace process is on between a faction led by its chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa and the government. The account delves into all major episodes, delineates their causes and effects and debunks interpretations about the movement that have gained currency over the years.”The author, in a press release made available to the media houses on Saturday with as excerpts from the book in a summarised version, states that the Bhutan King Jigme Sinye Wangchuk visited the camps of ULFA and NDFB before Operation All Clear was launched in 2003 that led to the elimination of all rebel camps in the country. He writes, “The first visit was in 1999 when the king accompanied by senior army officers visited ULFA’s central and general headquarters in Samdrup Jhonkar to convince the outfit to vacate the country. The second visit was in mid-2002 with the same objective but the king also proposed financial assistance to ULFA for vacating the country to another location. The king visited a camp of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) at Kalikhola in 2003 with the same objective of persuading the outfit to dismantle the camps and vacate the country.”In another portion, he stated that ULFA (Independent) supremo Paresh Baruah was imprisoned for over two months in Bangladesh by the country’s intelligence agency DGFI. “The episode unfolded in mid-1993 after a consignment of sophisticated weapons sourced from Romania in a ship was confiscated at Chittagong by the police. Paresh along with another senior functionary was put behind bars at DGFI’s custody in the Mirpur military cantonment after they approached the intelligence agency to release the weapons. The duo was released only after Paresh sat on a hunger strike inside the cell that prompted the agency to quiz them and then release them unconditionally.” Chief of the anti-talks faction of National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) Ranjan Daimary who is currently in jail in Assam for his role in the serial blasts in the state in 2008 was also interned at a police station for three days in Dhaka in 2000 after being apprehended at the airport. He was set free without being prosecuted, he added. The author gives an account of “a former director general of Assam police hired a surrendered ULFA (SULFA) activist to assassinate editor Anil Mazumdar in Guwahati on 24 March 2009.” After two weeks, the police chief hired another SULFA activist hailing from Nagaon to kill the assassin to eliminate all evidence. The police chief has formed a group of loyal SULFA activists to engage in business in the Mumbai dockyard and also to garner government contracts and grab land in Assam, it claimed. “The CID was unable to make any headway in Anil Mazumdar’s case which prompted Gauhati High Court to hand over the case to the CBI following a petition by the victim’s wife. The CBI identified a SULFA activist Bijoy Phukan as the murderer of Mazumdar,” it stated.According to the book excerpts, “Senior CPI (Maoist) functionary and military strategist Kishenji met ULFA chief of staff Paresh Baruah to firm up a deal for receiving weapons. Two consignments consisting of assault rifles, pistols and explosives were delivered by ULFA to CPI (Maoist) through routes crisscrossing West Bengal. The third consignment was seized at Bogra in Bangladesh before it could cross the border and the local media alleged that the ATTF from Tripura was involved in the operation.”Bhattacharyya also writes that the first attempt was made at ULFA’s camp in Bangladesh’s Satcherri when an assassin was sent by Special Branch of Assam police to kill Baruah. However, he escaped from the camp before he could pull the trigger. The second attempt was made by a senior officer of Assam police who got in touch with a criminal syndicate in Bangladesh to gun down Baruah which failed.“The same officer had also convinced an ULFA functionary turned mole named Munna Mishra to cross the border into Bangladesh and target Baruah. This attempt proved futile as well after Mishra was apprehended by the police in the neighbouring country after crossing the border. But he managed to return to India after a senior official from the Indian High Commission in Dhaka intervened to secure his release from police custody. The fourth attempt was in Dhaka when a boulder was hurled by an unknown person at Baruah at a crowded place in the car he was travelling. Baruah escaped unhurt although the windscreen of the vehicle was damaged,” the book excerpts stated.New Delhi, February 10",None,None,None,None,MExN,bangladesh,2024-02-10,2024-02-10

https://www.morungexpress.com/taking-a-leaf-out-bhishmas-rajdharma-and-pm-modis-vision-assam-scripts-new-destiny,"Taking a leaf out Bhishma's Rajdharma and PM Modi's vision, Assam scripts new destiny","""It is the foremost duty of a ruler to keep his subjects happy and gain their confidence. In the same manner, it is also his duty to always uphold the truth and maintain honesty and sincerity in his behaviour.""In the Shanti Parva of the Mahabharata, Bhishma Pitamah gives the aforementioned treatise on Rajdharma -- or the principles of governance -- to Dharmaraj Yudhishthira. This ancient wisdom of Rajdharma serves as an inspiration to public servants like me.When I became the Chief Minister of Assam on 10 May 2021, I sought to emulate these ideals. In front of me was the inspirational story of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a man who has lived up to the ideals of Rajdharma and served as an embodiment of righteousness. In 2014, he undertook a series of mammoth confidence-building initiatives to gain the trust of the people of the Northeast and win over their hearts with sincere love and devotion.As a result, when I took office, my mission was clear -- I had to take forward the vision of PM Modi and implement his policies on the ground. We have envisioned an Assam where we eliminate the problems faced by the people and script a new destiny for their future.Upon assuming office, we undertook various administrative reforms to improve governance. For example, we took the decision to hold weekly Cabinet meetings so as to make sure we are regularly communicating and updating ourselves to best govern the people of Assam. We have also held Cabinet meetings outside the capital, decentralising governance quite literally and taking it to different districts and towns.Through such measures, we have been able to take decisions and implement policies that have laid the foundation of a new Assam. Our double-engine government has been working in the relentless pursuit of Rajdharma through various avenues.The first major challenge we faced after assuming office was to improve the economic growth of a state that has historically been plagued by insurgency and militancy. Assam was lagging behind in key aspects of health, education and infrastructure. The state had minimal business activity, despite its tremendous potential.The first step towards regenerating economic growth was the construction of infrastructure and then the clearing up of legal and administrative bottlenecks. This was a process that had speedily begun since 2014.Assam in particular has witnessed unprecedented development in recent times, with the addition of several newly constructed bridges, the expansion of roads and highways, and the ongoing construction of a tunnel under the Brahmaputra. This infrastructure boost offers massive headroom for connectivity via road, air and sea, fostering economic growth.These measures by the Union government are being complemented in Assam by our state government policies that promote ease of doing business. With the decriminalisation of labour laws we have eliminated the risk of imprisonment for economic offences that do not involve mala fide acts. We have also repealed 364 old Acts to reduce the compliance burden on citizens and businesses. With a cheap land bank made available for industrial use, Assam paved the way for investors to establish manufacturing and other industries in the state.The state currently boasts of more than 50 industrial parks with sector-specific infrastructure, an industrial zone of 99.4 miles along the National Highways near Guwahati and the only industrial growth centre in India with access to four countries within 750 km at Matia.The latter is the most crucial, as India’s total exports to Bangladesh, Myanmar, Bhutan and Nepal stand at $17 billion, making Assam India's gateway to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Asia-Pacific.If we purely look at numbers, Assam’s gross domestic product (GDP) and per capita income have grown at unprecedented rates since 2014. The steep rise is a proof of the central government’s constant push for the development of Assam and the Northeast.The result of these measures has been that the gross state domestic product (GSDP) of Assam for 2023-24 (at current prices) is projected to be Rs 5.67 lakh crore, amounting to a growth of 15 per cent over 2022-23.In 2022-23, Assam's per capita income (at current prices) was estimated to be Rs 118,504, an increase of 15 per cent over 2021-22. In 2022-23, India's per capita income was estimated to increase by 14 per cent to Rs 170,620. According to the Periodic Labour Force Survey, in 2021–22, Assam’s unemployment rate was 4.9 per cent (as per current weekly status), lower than the national unemployment rate of 6.6 per cent.Currently, we are also working to calculate the GDP at the district level so as to understand the economic conditions of each district and work towards achieving equitable economic progress throughout the state.These steps taken by the state government, coupled with the Centre's push for strengthening geographical connectivity through building robust road and railway infrastructure along with building new airports, gave Assam the title of 'most improved big state' by India Today.New Delhi, February 5",None,None,None,None,IANS,bangladesh,2024-02-05,2024-02-05
