bangladesh,Daily Excelsior,https://www.dailyexcelsior.com/india-bangladesh-ties-role-model-for-neighbourhood-mahmud/,India-Bangladesh ties role model for neighbourhood: Mahmud,"February 08, 2024, 07:25 PM",2024-02-08,8-2-2024,"India’s decision to fence its border with Myanmar will help it and the region in view of insurgency flowing from the troubled country, Bangladesh Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud said on Thursday even as he asserted that Dhaka is firmly maintaining a policy of “zero tolerance” for terrorism.In an interactive session at a think-tank, Mahmud described 1.2 million “forcibly displaced” Rohingya refugees as a “burden” on Bangladesh and sought India’s assistance for their repatriation to Myanmar.The visiting minister said the refugees are creating environmental and security problems besides other difficulties for Bangladesh and that the Sheikh Hasina Government has been in touch with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to check the flow of refugees.To a volley of questions on the fairness of the recent parliamentary elections in Bangladesh, Mahmud said it was the most vibrant, participatory and fair polls in the country’s history.“The Indian government stood by us in holding free and fair elections as they stood by us in 1972,” he said referring to New Delhi’s historic role in the liberation of Bangladesh from Pakistan.Mahmud is on a four-day visit to India from Tuesday, in his first bilateral foreign trip since Hasina came to power for a fifth term after a landslide victory in the parliamentary elections last month.Describing the current state of relations between India and Bangladesh as a “golden chapter”, he said the two sides are now giving highest priority to three aspects — enhancing mutual trust and confidence, promoting connectivity and ensuring all round economic cooperation.“We are going through a golden chapter of our relationship. India-Bangladesh relationship is now a role model for the neighbourhood and democracy today,” he said at the Vivekananda International Foundation (VIF).The Bangladesh foreign minister said the current situation in Myanmar is worrying and called India’s decision to fence its border with that country as a good move.“Fencing the India-Myanmar border would be good for India and the region as I think there is insurgency (flowing) from Myanmar. In recent weeks, hundreds of people fled from Myanmar to India and Bangladesh. That is why the Indian Government decided to go for it (to fence the border),” he said.Last month, India announced plans to secure the 1,643-km boundary with Myanmar by erecting fences along the land border.On the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, Mahmud said a case has already been filed at the International Court of Justice on the matter and that Dhaka is also in touch with New Delhi.“We have been having discussions with Myanmar for the last seven years so that it takes them back with full dignity and honour. Myanmar has been saying that they would take them back but they are adopting delaying tactics,” he said.Mahmud said the current situation in Myanmar is an “obstacle” to sending back the refugees, but he hoped the crisis will be over very soon and “we will be able to send them back.”In this respect, we expect assistance and cooperation from the Indian side, he said.Myanmar has been witnessing wide-spread violent protests demanding restoration of democracy since the military seized power in the coup on February 1, 2021.Rakhine state and many other regions have reported severe fighting between armed ethnic groups and the Myanmarese military since October last year.India on Tuesday asked its citizens in Rakhine to leave the troubled-region immediately in view of deteriorating security situation.Mahmud said Bangladesh will not allow any terrorist activities on its soil.“While assuming power in 2009, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina declared a zero tolerance policy against terrorism. She declared that our land would not be allowed for any terrorist activities to destabilise any neighbouring country or the region and we have been following that,” he said.On his talks with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and NSA Ajit Doval on Wednesday, Mahmud said a range of issues were discussed including that of Rohingyas, Teesta river water and security.He said defence and security cooperation between the two countries are on an upswing, adding Dhaka will make defence purchases from India.His response came when asked whether Bangladesh is contemplating procuring Light Combat Aircraft Tejas, Dhruv choppers and other military hardware.",Content Summary not found
bangladesh,Daily Excelsior,https://www.dailyexcelsior.com/saff-u-19-womens-final-india-face-gritty-bangladesh-in-summit-clash/,SAFF U-19 Women’s final: India face gritty Bangladesh in summit clash,"February 07, 2024, 06:14 PM",2024-02-07,7-2-2024,"The Indian football team will be out to break a jinx as it takes on hosts Bangladesh in the SAFF U-19 Women’s Championship final here on Thursday.   Despite improvement in women’s football, India somehow hold a dismal record in this age-group in SAFF.   The title has eluded India on more than one occasion, the latest being the SAFF U20 Women’s Championship in Dhaka last year, when Bangladesh pipped them to win the trophy.  The upcoming final will definitely be a huge opportunity for India to put past records on the burner and retain the title.   The Young Tigresses will enter the final match with a strong determination to win the championship title and set the records straight from the Indian perspective.  In the group stage, India won comfortably against Bhutan (10-0) and Nepal (4-0) but lost to Bangladesh by a solitary goal before entering the final as the second-place finishers in the group.   Apart from having a tight defence and a balanced midfield, India enjoy good attacking qualities with forwards Pooja and Sulanjana Raul and wingers Neha and Sibani Devi putting up a commendable show.  However, it will definitely not be easy to topple the hosts, who beat India in the group league earlier this week. No one knows it better than India’s head coach, Sukla Dutta.  “I’m truly not pleased that India have been losing to Bangladesh for the past three years, but tomorrow will be the time to change that. I am sure both teams will put in equal efforts, but the team who score first will likely emerge champion, as the confidence to score more will start from there,” she said ahead of the Bangladesh clash.  “I understand there will be huge support for Bangladesh, but we’ll only concentrate on our own game,” she said.  Having already played against Bangladesh in the group stage, the India head coach knows how to handle the situation.  “We know exactly how they play. But there’s no doubt they’re a good side. I have instructed my players to stay focused on their positions and prioritise man-marking.   “It’s crucial to cover the midfield more effectively because if we disrupt their ball distribution in that area, we can perform even better.”",Content Summary not found
bangladesh,Daily Excelsior,https://www.dailyexcelsior.com/2-killed-as-mortar-shells-from-myanmar-lands-in-bangladesh/,2 killed as mortar shells from Myanmar lands in Bangladesh,"February 05, 2024, 04:39 PM",2024-02-05,5-2-2024,"At least two people were killed when mortar shells from the Myanmar side landed across the border in a Bangladeshi village while 95 Burmese paramilitary border guards fled their posts and took refuge in this country in the past two days, officials said on Monday. “One of the two slain people is a Bangladeshi woman while the other is a Rohingya man. They were killed on Sunday in the Japaitali area near the border,” said Shah Mujahid Uddin, Bandarban Deputy Commissioner and Administrative Chief. The police said a 50-year-old woman was serving food to a 58-year-old ethnic Rohingya daily wage labourer when the shell hit the area, instantly killing the two. Meanwhile, Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) officials said 27 more paramilitary Border Guard Police of Myanmar overnight crossed the border as fierce gunfights continued on the other side of the frontier between the government troops and rebel Arakan Army. “The number of BGP personnel in our (BGB) custody now stands at 95. Most of them brought their weapons along with themselves,” a BGB spokesman told reporters here. He said several of them crossed the border with bullet wounds and were being treated at different hospitals, including health facilities in Rohingya camps. Doctors have said several of them were in critical condition. Officials and residents at the bordering villages said Myanmar military helicopters continued strafing at Tombry region to support the government troops during their encounters with the rebel insurgents in the Rakhine state. Myanmar’s Rakhine state, which has a 270-kilometre border with Bangladesh, has witnessed frequent clashes since last November when the Arakan Army fighters ended a ceasefire largely enforced since a 2021 coup. Monday’s death was, however, the first such incident of casualties inside Bangladesh. Security officials called unprecedented the fleeing of the Myanmar BGP forces who abandoned their posts amid the insurgency in their land to take refuge to their BGB counterpart across the border. “Nearly a company of paramilitary troops crossed the international boundary and laid down their weapons to Bangladeshi border guards. This may have deep implications on the geopolitics of the region for which Bangladesh needs to prepare itself,” security analyst retired brigadier general Sakhawat Hossain said. Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan on Sunday said the border guards from neighbouring Myanmar’s Rakhine state had “entered our territory for self-protection” and Bangladesh received them as a humanitarian gesture. “The BGB informed the development to their Myanmar counterparts,” a BGB spokesman said. Bangladesh’s Refugee, Relief and Repatriation (RRR) commissioner Mohammad Mizanur Rahman said the fierce conflict forced over 400 Buddhist Rakhine people to take refuge near the border but the BGB declined to allow them to enter Bangladeshi territory yet. Dhaka, on Sunday, expressed concerns as the skirmishes in its borders with Myanmar affected Bangladesh frontlines with Road Transport Minister and Awami League General Secretary Obaidul Quader seeking Chinese intervention to de-escalate the conflict because of Beijing’s close contacts with Burmese authorities. “The internal war is their (Myanmar’s) domestic concern. But when the sound of gunfights is heard at the border, naturally it creates panic in the public mind. We, therefore, expect Beijing’s intervention,” Quader told the media after he met with the Chinese envoy. The BGB asked residents to stay indoors or move cautiously as the skirmishes in southern and northern parts of Tombru, also known by the same name in Myanmar, appeared to be fiercest so far. Tombru is located in Ghungdhum union of Naikhhangchhari upazila of Bandarban district. The Arakan Army in October last year allied with two other insurgent groups and launched a joint offensive across northern Myanmar, seizing vital trade hubs on the Chinese border. The alliance last month announced a China-mediated ceasefire which, however, does not apply to areas near the Bangladesh and Indian borders. Bangladesh’s border with Myanmar stretches 271.0 kilometres, from the tri-point with India in the north to the Bay of Bengal in the south. Bangladesh played a critical role in sheltering over a million Muslim minority Rohingyas who fled their home in Rakhine and took refuge in the country to evade persecution, particularly after a 2017 army crackdown. The current crisis, however, has little to do with the Rohingyas. Bangladesh won praise for the handling of the world’s biggest refugee crisis. At the same time, Dhaka repeatedly sought their repatriation to their homeland in Rakhine saying the Rohingyas were causing economic, social, security and environmental problems. The issue is now the subject of a United Nations genocide investigation at the International Court of Justice.",Content Summary not found
bangladesh,Daily Excelsior,https://www.dailyexcelsior.com/58-myanmar-border-guards-seek-shelter-in-bangladesh-as-battle-rages-between-military-insurgents/,"58 Myanmar border guards seek shelter in Bangladesh as battle rages between military, insurgents","February 04, 2024, 03:59 PM",2024-02-04,4-2-2024,"At least 58 soldiers of Myanmar’s paramilitary Border Guard Police (BGP) escaping the junta-run country took shelter in Bangladesh amid reports of heavy gunfights between the government troops and the rebel resistance fighters, officials said here on Sunday. The soldiers entered through the Tambru border in predawn hours on Sunday and sought shelter from the Bangladesh Border Guard (BGB). “Fifty-eight BGP personnel took shelter in Bangladesh throughout the day since the predawn hours. Fourteen of them crossed the border with bullet wounds and are being treated at different hospitals, including health facilities in Rohingya camps,” said an official familiar with the development. The official, who preferred anonymity, said the paramilitary soldiers were kept under their counterpart Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) custody in southeastern Cox’s Bazar bordering Myanmar’s Rakhine state while the weapons they carried were deposited in BGB cache. The official said many of the soldiers came to Bangladesh territory in combat uniforms and weapons while others were in their plainclothes leaving their arms back home. “The BGB informed the development to their Myanmar counterparts,” said the official. Dhaka, meanwhile, expressing concern over the skirmishes in its border areas with Myanmar, said the violence was affecting Bangladesh’s frontlines. Road Transport Minister and Awami League General Secretary Obaidul Quader sought Chinese intervention to de-escalate the conflict given Beijing’s close contacts with Burmese authorities. “The internal war is their (Myanmar’s) domestic concern. But when the sound of gunfights is heard at the border, naturally it creates panic in the public mind. We, therefore, expect Beijing’s intervention,” Quader told the media after he met with the Chinese envoy. Officials earlier said 14 BGP personnel crossed the border in predawn hours through the Ghumdhum border while a BGB spokesman in Dhaka thereafter asked journalists to await a media briefing on the development. No official briefing was however done until Sunday evening. District administration of Bandarban, where the troubled frontier is located, closed five schools for security reasons fearing mortar shells or stray bullets will slide into the Bangladesh territory as the gunfights are underway on the other side of the border. The BGB asked residents to stay indoors or move cautiously. Officials said reports from the other side of the border suggested army helicopters were strafing on rebel fighters, escalating concerns of massive casualties. Residents in frontier villages, including local Union Parishad members, said sounds of gunfights on the Myanmar side of the border on Saturday night and Sunday panicked residents in villages in the frontier. A BSS report said the skirmishes between the government troops and the rebel Arakan Army frightened residents in several frontier Bangladesh villages as many mortar shells and bullets landed at the Bangladeshi side in the past few days though no casualty was reported so far. “In two such latest incidents on Saturday night a bullet smashed the windshield of a battery-run three-wheeler and a mortar shell hit a village house at Tombru area of Ghumdhum but no one was wounded,” a member of the local union council, the lowest local government-tier, told reporters. Bangladesh earlier ordered an extra security vigil on the border with Myanmar given the gunfights between the military and the insurgent Arakan Army, which is active in the bordering Rakhine region of the country. International media reports suggested several more insurgent groups, some forming alliances among themselves, are confronting the military in several parts of Myanmar. According to reports and analysts, the resistance movement in Myanmar gained momentum three years after a coup ended a short-lived experiment with democracy. Bangladesh’s border with Myanmar stretches 271.0 kilometres (168.4 miles) from the tri-point with India in the north to the Bay of Bengal in the south. Bangladesh played a critical role in sheltering over a million Muslim minority Rohingyas who fled their home in Rakhine and took refuge in Bangladesh to evade persecution, particularly after a 2017 army crackdown but the current crisis has little to do with the Rohingyas.

The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) accused the 83-year-old economist and 13 others of misappropriating around Tk 25.22 crore (approximately USD 2.29 million) of Grameen Telecom Workers’ Profit Participation Fund. Yunus is the chairman of Grameen Telecom –which he founded as a non-profit organisation– while the co-defendants include its directors, managing director and employees’ trade union leaders. “We have filed the charge sheet against him (Yunus) and 13 others before the Metropolitan Senior Special Judge’s Court of Dhaka,” an ACC spokesman told reporters. The court has set March 3 for an indictment hearing of the case. Law Minister Anisul Huq rejected allegations of harassing Yunus, saying the government did not fabricate any false cases against him. “Dr Yunus was warned and advised to prevent these violations, but he ignored them. So, the Labour Department filed a lawsuit,” Huq said. “No one is above the law, and if someone commits a crime, they must face the law,” the minister said. Earlier, ACC Secretary Mahmub Hossain said the proceedings against Yunus were initiated based on complaints against him by the Department of Inspection for Factories and Establishments, and the statutory graft agency filed the charge sheet after a long investigation. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his anti-poverty campaign, earning Bangladesh the reputation of being the home of microcredit through his Grameen Bank, which he founded in 1983. He faces over 150 other cases, including major corruption charges that could see him jailed for years if found guilty. The economist denies all wrongdoing. Last week, an appeals court granted bail to Yunus, who was sentenced on January 1 to six months in prison for violating the country’s labour laws. The court also agreed to hear an appeal against his sentencing. Thursday’s development came days after more than 241 global leaders, including over 125 Nobel laureates, expressed their concerns over the “continuous judicial harassment and potential jailing” of Yunus in a third open letter to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Irene Khan, the UN Special Rapporteur for the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression, called the January 1 verdict “a travesty of justice”. Khan said the social activist “who brought honour and pride to the country is being persecuted on frivolous grounds.” “We agree with Irene Khan,” said a letter signed by global leaders, including former US President Barack Obama. The letter said that the verdict was the outcome of “the rushed legal process and lack of consistency about how Bangladesh’s laws are applied.” Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also reacted to the verdict. “Bangladeshis deserve a government that honours and supports — rather than persecutes — its most esteemed citizens,” he said. “I call on the prime minister (Sheikh Hasina) to stop this senseless campaign against Professor Muhammad Yunus now,” he said. Hasina’s Awami League party won a record fourth consecutive term in the general election held on January 7. International rights groups, including Amnesty International, also condemned the verdict while several leading Bangladeshi civil society figures said Yunus was exposed to legal “harassment”. In response to the global leaders’ previous letter, Hasina recently told a news conference that the signatories “should send experts, including lawyers, to go through all the documents of Professor Yunus and his cases to see if there is any wrongdoing or wrongful prosecution.” The global leaders agreed to her proposal in their third letter, published as a full-page advertisement in the Washington Post on Monday. “We accept your invitation . . . (But) this examination should include not only the labour law case whose verdict was delivered on January 1, but also the investigation being conducted by the Anti-Corruption Commission,” read the letter. The previous two letters were issued in March 2023 and August 2023. The prominent economist was in a protracted row with the incumbent government due to obscure reasons.  The government led by Hasina launched a series of investigations against him after coming to power in 2008. Many people believe that Hasina became enraged when Yunus announced he would form a political party in 2007 when the country was run by a military-backed government and she was in prison. However, Yunus did not follow through on the plan but criticised politicians in the country, alleging they were only interested in making money.",Content Summary not found

She also participated in the 13th Summer Davos Forum in Dalian. During the visit, Hasina called on Chinese President Xi Jinping.“China reiterated its position to further strengthen the bilateral relations during the tenure of the new government in Bangladesh,” the foreign ministry, meanwhile said in a statement after the envoy met with the minister.Soon after the January 7 polls, Chinese President Xi congratulated Hasina and expressed confidence in boosting the bilateral ties.Bangladesh foreign ministry officials said China wanted Hasina to visit China in September last year but the election and other engagements prevented her from visiting at that time.China’s invitation came shortly after the ruling party’s general secretary and Road Transport Minister Obaidul Quader said India stood beside Bangladesh when BNP tried to foil the polls.“There is no reason for our relations with India to be strained,” Quader told reporters after Indian High Commissioner in Dhaka Pranay Kumar Verma called on him. Quader said he believed “the wall of confusion and mistrust was finally smashed by Hasina and her Indian counterpart Narendra Modi”.A senior foreign ministry official preferring anonymity said Dhaka would continue to strike a balance in the relationship both with India and China as “we need them both for our stability and development”.According to analysts, Hasina deserved credit for skillfully negotiating the rival interests of India and China as Bangladesh is virtually sandwiched between the two feuding Asian giants. She also received the support of the big neighbours and Russia ahead of the elections.India called the Bangladesh election an “internal matter” and Beijing spoke in the same tone while the Western powers, including the United States have called for credible polls.",Content Summary not found

He also effected a run-out.What was impressive to see was no overt celebrations from either Saumy or Musheer, who carried on their job like thoroughbred professionals. It was a fairly ill-tempered match with players from both sides indulging in sledging as the two teams have history of tension across senior men, senior women and U-19 level.For Indian team, it was a sweet revenge after losing the Asia Cup semi-final to Bangladesh.While the Indian batters found it difficult to get boundaries, the target was never below par as average score of teams batting first in Youth ODIs (U-19 ODI) at this ground was 201, and the highest successful chase being 243. In fact, India’s 251/7 on the day was the third highest score at this ground.The team’s designated finisher Sachin Dhas showed admirable technique and temperament during death overs with a nice little unbeaten cameo of 26 off 20 balls that took the score past 250-run mark. The pulled six off seamer Rohanat Doullah Borson was a treat for the eyes. This despite allowing Bangladeshi bowlers to bowl dot balls worth 26 overs during their innings.Left-arm seamer Maruf Mridha (5/43) did damage at the start and during slog overs by bowling in right areas but would be a bit miffed with his skipper, who got his calculations wrong and didn’t let him complete his quota of 10 overs.Possessing a skiddy action like Mustafizur Rahaman, Maruf varied his lengths, bowled closer to stumps at the start and mixed cutters with wide yorkers at the death to make life difficult for the India colts.The foundation of the Indian innings was laid by Adarsh (76 off 96 balls) and skipper Saharan (64 off 94 balls), who added 116 runs for the third wicket in nearly 23.5 overs.The two youngsters didn’t look comfortable against the Bangladesh spinners — offie Sheikh Paevez Jibon (0/39) and left-arm spinner Mahfuzur Rahaman Rabby (1/41).The two spinners didn’t let the set batters get away as Adarsh had six fours and Saharan only four. In fact, Indian batters got only 14 boundaries and two sixes in 50 overs but it proved to be enough in the end.",Content Summary not found

The final against the hosts was washed out.But India will also guard against complacency against Bangladesh having lost the U-19 Asia Cup semifinal in a largely one-sided contest in December.

That election was held under a neutral caretaker government,” and asked how will they (the BNP) face the elections?Many people thought in 2008 that the BNP was equal to Awami League considering the organisational strength, she said, adding, “But it was proved wrong in the 2008 election. The BNP never wanted an election. They instead unleashed arson attacks killing people and setting fire to trains to foil the elections.”“The more they (BNP) unleash the arson attack the more people will reject them. They know that they were rejected by the people,” she said and added, this is why the BNP does not want to participate in the election. “Rather they wanted to spoil the election and looked for the illegal way to be in power.”",Content Summary not found

The Bangladesh government had invited a large number of foreign observers from India and other countries, as well as multilateral organisations, to observe the elections.The US State Department, in a press statement Monday, said that Washington remains concerned by the arrests of thousands of political opposition members and by reports of irregularities on election day in Bangladesh.“The United States shares the view with other observers that these elections were not free or fair and we regret that not all parties participated,” the State Department said.“We encourage the Government of Bangladesh to credibly investigate reports of violence and to hold perpetrators accountable. We also urge all political parties to reject violence,” it said.UN Human Rights Chief Volker Turk called on Bangladesh’s newly elected government to take steps to renew the country’s commitment to democracy and human rights, voicing distress that the environment for Sunday’s poll was marred by violence and repression of opposition candidates and supporters.“In the months leading up to the vote, thousands of opposition supporters have been detained arbitrarily or subjected to intimidation. Such tactics are not conducive to a truly genuine process,” Türk said and noted that democracy was “hard-won” in Bangladesh and “must not become cosmetic.”Around 25,000 opposition supporters have been arrested, including key party leaders, since October, the UN official said and raised serious concerns about possible torture or harsh conditions of detention as at least 10 opposition supporters reportedly died – or were killed – in custody in the last two months.An associate spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Florencia Soto Niño, in response to a question on whether the UN believes the elections were free and fair, said, “We have seen the situation that’s unfolding there. The Secretary-General continues to follow what’s happening. He notes the opposition’s decision to boycott the elections.”She said the UN chief is “obviously concerned” about reports of incidents of violence prior to, and during the elections.The UK said that standards of credible and fair competition were not consistently met during Bangladesh’s 12th parliamentary elections. “Not all political parties took part in the elections. The Bangladeshi people did not therefore have the fullest range of voting options,” UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) said in a statement on Monday.It said democratic elections depend on credible, open, and fair competition and respect for human rights, the rule of law and due process are essential elements of the democratic process while “these standards were not consistently met during the election period.”The FCDO statement also expressed concern at the “significant number of arrests of opposition party members before polling day.”In contrast, there were greetings and applause that were showered on Hasina by India, China, Russia and several other countries from across Asia, West Asia, Africa and South America on Monday and Tuesday.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called up his counterpart in person and congratulated her on her historic re-election on Monday and reiterated India’s commitment to further strengthen the “enduring and people-centric partnership” with its neighbour.Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe called the electoral triumph of Awami League a “testament to the trust and confidence bestowed by the people of Bangladesh in Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s capable leadership” and expressed confidence that “Hasina’s wisdom and wealth of experience will continue to benefit the people of Bangladesh.”A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman on Tuesday said Beijing congratulated Bangladesh for the successful holding of the election as planned and felicitated Awami League for winning the election.“As an amicable and close neighbour of Bangladesh, China firmly supports Bangladesh in implementing the political agendas in accordance with its law after the election,” she said.According to the Bangladesh Prime Minister’s Office, ambassadors of Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, South Korea, Brunei, Malaysia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran, Qatar and Palestine called on the premier and greeted her for the election victory on Tuesday.A Bangladesh PMO spokesman said ambassadors of India, Russia, China, Bhutan, the Philippines, Singapore and Sri Lanka called on the premier at her Ganobhaban residence on Monday and pledged continued support of their countries for Bangladesh.",Content Summary not found

None can now prevent Bangladesh’s advancement,” she saidIn an emotionally choked voice, the 76-year-old leader called the people of Bangladesh as her family members and remembered the August 15, 1975 carnage when a military coup killed her father and Bangladesh’s founder Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman along with most of his family members.Hasina said she was extra thankful to the voters as they turned up in huge numbers defying the Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s (BNP) violent boycott campaign through clandestine arson attacks on passenger trains and transport blockades and voted her party to power for the fourth straight term.In line with the constitutional provision, Hasina was expected to meet later on Wednesday President Mohammad Shahabuddin to seek his approval to form her new government after the 12th general elections, when she would be the premier for the fifth time and record straight fourth time consecutively.Soon after the Awami League Parliamentary Party (ALPP) elected her as the Leader of the House, Hasina told them: “Your highest priority must be the welfare of the people”.“You (MPs) will have to ensure balanced development in your respective constituencies,” she said.The ALPP also reelected incumbent parliamentary speaker Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury and senior Awami League leader and former minister Begum Matia Chowdhury as the deputy leader of the House.Bangladesh’s new cabinet is expected to take oath on Thursday with President Shahabuddin to administer the ministers’ oath of office at Bangabhaban presidential palace.Hasina, ruling the South Asian nation since 2009, secured a fifth overall term in the one-sided election in which she secured a record fourth consecutive term and fifth overall term on Sunday.Hasina’s Awami League won 223 seats in the 300-member Parliament in the general elections that were held on Sunday.With this win, Hasina is poised to become the longest-serving prime minister in Bangladesh since it gained independence from Pakistan in 1971.",Content Summary not found

The 76-year-old leader, who has been ruling the strategically located South Asian nation since 2009, secured a fifth overall term in the one-sided election on Sunday, which witnessed a low turnout. “India is a great friend of Bangladesh. They have supported us in 1971 and also in 1975. They gave shelter to me and my sister and my other family members,” she said, referring to her period in exile when she stayed in India for six years after the killing of her family members. In August 1975, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, his wife and their three sons were assassinated in their home by military officers. His daughters Hasina and Rehana survived the purge as they were abroad. “We consider India as our next-door neighbour. We had many problems but we resolved it bilaterally. So, I really appreciate that we have a wonderful relationship with India,” she said while responding to a question. “I have a good relationship with every country because that is our motto,” she added. She said that the main focus of her government in the next five years will be on economic progress. She said she tries to work for her people. “With motherly affection, I look after my people who gave me this opportunity. Time and again people have voted for me, and that is why I am here,” she added. When compared to global leaders like former Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi and Sri Lanka’s former prime minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Hasina said, “They are very great ladies. I am not. I am very simple, just a common person.”",Content Summary not found
