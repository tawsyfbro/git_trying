https://theprint.in/world/myanmar-juntas-conscription-plan-lays-bare-toll-of-fighting-rebels/1971039/,Myanmar junta’s conscription plan lays bare toll of fighting rebels,"(Reuters) -The Myanmar’s military conscription plan reveals the heavy toll that months of incessant fighting against rebels have had on its troops and the struggles the generals are facing to replenish their ranks, analysts, diplomats and a defector said.The plan, which was announced this week, comes after the junta lost control of swathes of territory along a frontline that stretches from the highlands bordering China to the coastline near Bangladesh, some of it in a coordinated offensive by rebel groups that started in October, dubbed Operation 1027.“The military is clearly facing significant manpower shortages, which is why it is introducing a draft for the first time in its history,” said Richard Horsey, the Crisis Group’s senior Myanmar adviser.Show Full Article(Reuters) -The Myanmar’s military conscription plan reveals the heavy toll that months of incessant fighting against rebels have had on its troops and the struggles the generals are facing to replenish their ranks, analysts, diplomats and a defector said.The plan, which was announced this week, comes after the junta lost control of swathes of territory along a frontline that stretches from the highlands bordering China to the coastline near Bangladesh, some of it in a coordinated offensive by rebel groups that started in October, dubbed Operation 1027.“The military is clearly facing significant manpower shortages, which is why it is introducing a draft for the first time in its history,” said Richard Horsey, the Crisis Group’s senior Myanmar adviser.Show Full ArticleThe plan, which was announced this week, comes after the junta lost control of swathes of territory along a frontline that stretches from the highlands bordering China to the coastline near Bangladesh, some of it in a coordinated offensive by rebel groups that started in October, dubbed Operation 1027.“The military is clearly facing significant manpower shortages, which is why it is introducing a draft for the first time in its history,” said Richard Horsey, the Crisis Group’s senior Myanmar adviser.Show Full Article“The military is clearly facing significant manpower shortages, which is why it is introducing a draft for the first time in its history,” said Richard Horsey, the Crisis Group’s senior Myanmar adviser.A junta spokesman did not respond to calls from Reuters seeking comment. The military has been battling an expanding armed resistance since a 2021 coup toppled the democratically elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, and the junta describes the resistance fighters as “terrorists”, blaming them for destroying Myanmar’s peace and stability.The conscription plan, slated to start in April, will require all men aged 18 to 35 and women aged 18 to 27 to serve for up to two years, while specialists like doctors aged up to 45 must serve for three years. The service can be extended to a total of five years, according to state media.Ye Myo Hein, senior advisor to the United States Institute of Peace think-tank, assessed most military battalions are currently struggling to meet the even half the recommended troop strength of 200 soldiers. “There has been a notable decline in the number of officer enlistments as well,” he told Reuters. “Additionally, the loss of officers, including Brigadier Generals…have been significantly higher due to shrinking battalion sizes and decreasing rank-and-file soldiers.”Last year, Ye Myo Hein estimated the Myanmar military had around 70,000 combat soldiers, citing interviews with military deserters and defectors, analysis of military documents and  casualty counts.Anthony Davis, a security analyst with British-based Jane’s intelligence company, had estimated the total strength of the rebel ethnic armies at around 75,000 in 2021. The current size of the anti-junta resistance is now likely higher with the emergence of more resistance groups as the conflict drags on, analysts said.The Tatmadaw, as the military is known, has not publicly declared the size of its fighting force in recent years.Miemie Winn Byrd, an analyst who previously served in the U.S. army, said defections had risen sharply in the past few months, based on interviews with military battalion commanders and other soldiers who had deserted.“Myanmar’s military forces are fatigued and demoralised,” she said, adding that basic supplies such as food and equipment were in short supply.Former army captain Htet Myat, who defected in June 2021 and now helps other soldiers defect, told Reuters in December that some battalions only had around 130 soldiers. Htet Myat said he defected because he opposed the 2021 coup.The military’s battlefield defeats have lead to unprecedented public calls for Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing to step down three years after the junta took power from the civilian government.TROOPS SPREAD THINEven with the mandatory recruitment, the military may not be able to rapidly ramp up its manpower, said Crisis Group’s Horsey. “It does not have the organisational capability to train large numbers of new recruits simultaneously,” he added.A dozen people eligible to serve also told Reuters that they would rather leave the country than join the military. They all declined to be named citing security concerns.At its current strength, the military does not have the manpower to effectively fight opposition troops on multiple fronts, according to a December analysis by Andrew Selth, an adjunct professor at the Griffith Asia Institute.“The generals know how thinly spread their troops are, and how difficult it is to fight more than one major battle at the same time,” said Selth, who has studied Myanmar, particularly the military, for decades.“The use of air power, armour and artillery gives the junta certain advantages, but ultimately only troops on the ground can win back territory and exert its will over the population.”In the western region of Rakhine, where the military is fighting the Arakan Army (AA), troops have been pushed out of at least five towns, a spokesman for the ethnic armed group said.The military has not publicly commented on the loss of territory.“They couldn’t send backup troops in Rakhine battles,” AA spokesman Khine Thu Kha told Reuters via phone. “That means they don’t have enough forces.” (Reporting by Reuters Staff, Writing by Devjyot Ghoshal; editing by Miral Fahmy)Disclaimer: This report is auto generated from the Reuters news service.

Htet Myat said he defected because he opposed the 2021 coup.The military’s battlefield defeats have lead to unprecedented public calls for Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing to step down three years after the junta took power from the civilian government.TROOPS SPREAD THINEven with the mandatory recruitment, the military may not be able to rapidly ramp up its manpower, said Crisis Group’s Horsey. “It does not have the organisational capability to train large numbers of new recruits simultaneously,” he added.A dozen people eligible to serve also told Reuters that they would rather leave the country than join the military. They all declined to be named citing security concerns.At its current strength, the military does not have the manpower to effectively fight opposition troops on multiple fronts, according to a December analysis by Andrew Selth, an adjunct professor at the Griffith Asia Institute.“The generals know how thinly spread their troops are, and how difficult it is to fight more than one major battle at the same time,” said Selth, who has studied Myanmar, particularly the military, for decades.“The use of air power, armour and artillery gives the junta certain advantages, but ultimately only troops on the ground can win back territory and exert its will over the population.”In the western region of Rakhine, where the military is fighting the Arakan Army (AA), troops have been pushed out of at least five towns, a spokesman for the ethnic armed group said.The military has not publicly commented on the loss of territory.“They couldn’t send backup troops in Rakhine battles,” AA spokesman Khine Thu Kha told Reuters via phone. “That means they don’t have enough forces.” (Reporting by Reuters Staff, Writing by Devjyot Ghoshal; editing by Miral Fahmy)Disclaimer: This report is auto generated from the Reuters news service.

After we raised the concern, we met the home minister, we met other leaders, then there was a revisit in the entire draft and they came up with a provision where Meghalaya and other areas with sixth schedule and ILP was exempted,” Sangma told PTI.“In every area in Meghalaya, except a few square metres in Shillong… small area which we call European ward, is the only area which is a non schedule area. Majority of the state is scheduled area. Once an exemption is there, we don’t have any concerns. So our concerns have been addressed,” Sangma said.“We have just requested the Government of India if we can still have the ILP… Because whatever happens in other states could have spill-over effect here, we have requested for that. We are happy that the Government of India exempted Meghalaya. We have asked if the non-scheduled area can also be exempted, though it is very very small,” he said.He also mentioned a resolution passed by the state Assembly to extend the ILP to the state.The Meghalaya Assembly in December 2019 had adopted a resolution for implementing the ILP regime in the state.The ILP is a special permit required by “outsiders” from other regions of India to enter the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Mizoram and Manipur.“Our concerns are that anybody from outside the country is a non-Indian, and illegal immigration is illegal immigration. Citizens coming from other countries would be in a way foreigners coming into our country,” he added.Passed in December 2019 by the Parliament, the CAA grants Indian nationality to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Parsis and Christians from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, who arrived in India till December 31, 2014.Home Minister Amit Shah has said rules for implementing the CAA will be issued before the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.The provisions of the Act will not apply to the tribal areas of Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Tripura, included in the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution.The Sixth Schedule protects tribal populations, providing autonomy to communities through the creation of Autonomous Development Councils, which can frame laws on land, public health and agriculture.Asked about Manipur Chief Minister Biren Singh’s statement on deporting those who have come in the state after 1961, Sangma said it is for the state and the Union governments to decide, but added, “The situation in Manipur is complicated and those decisions will have to be taken keeping ground factors in mind. It is for the Government of India and the Government of Manipur to decide,” he said.“From a practical point of view, it is very complicated. How will they implement that decision has to be equally looked into,” he added. PTI AO MNK MNKThis report is auto-generated from PTI news service.

Other news that got coverage were this week’s trust vote in the Bihar assembly and Pakistan’s elections. Here’s a roundup of all the news that made front-page headlines and editorials in the Urdu press this week. Also Read: Modi, BJP CMs undermined secularism: Urdu press on states declaring public holidays for consecrationElectoral bondAll three prominent Urdu newspapers — the Siasat, Roznama Rashtriya Sahara, and Inquilab — hailed the Supreme Court’s ruling on the Electoral Bond Scheme. A five-judge Constitution bench comprising CJI D.Y. Chandrachud, and Justices Sanjiv Khanna, B.R. Gavai, J.B. Pardiwala, and Manoj Misra ruled that the scheme — introduced by the Modi-led National Democratic Alliance — violated the right to information under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.A 16 February editorial in Sahara stated that the central government’s argument that the scheme is aimed at bringing about transparency, was futile. What we are witnessing now is an era of politics where digital technology is being used for surveillance, the editorial further stated. “No one knows when, where, and whose mobile or computer will be monitored. A microchip can track a person’s bank account, identification, preferences, activities, and (even) political and social inclinations in a matter of seconds. Therefore, it’s not difficult to ascertain who purchased electoral bonds from which branch of the State Bank of India, and which party has encashed them,” the editorial read.Farmers’ protestThe ongoing farmers’ protest has been the reigning topic in the Urdu press, with editorials criticising the use of police force at Shambhu on the Punjab-Haryana border. On 15 February, Sahara’s editorial stated that the use of force demonstrates how this “capitalistic” dispensation is unwilling to do much for farmers and labourers. This came a day after another one of its editorials criticised the government for not seriously considering the farmers’ demands. “It makes various claims about being concerned about the welfare of the farmers, but it seems that all of this is just a show, and the government is not actually prepared to enact the law that the farmers are demanding,” this editorial on 14 February said. “Instead of reassuring the farmers and gaining their trust through dialogue, the government is resorting to using tear gas and water cannons. This isn’t the solution to the problem.”On 13 February, Siasat carried a report on its front page titled ‘Kya Modi ke guroor ka phir sir hoga neecha?’ (Will Modi’s pride be broken yet again?). In this article, the newspaper covered the farmers’ ‘Delhi Chalo’ march and reported how police had heightened security around the national capital and how prohibitory orders had been imposed in the city. Also Read: ‘Mere claims without tangible outcomes can’t resolve poverty’ — Urdu press on NITI Aayog reportBihar politics The trust vote in the Bihar assembly and the removal of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Awadh Bihari Choudhary from the Speaker’s position also got prominent coverage this week. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who last month switched his allegiance back to the BJP-led NDA, won the trust vote amid an Opposition walkout.  In its editorial on 13 February, Siasat said that despite the recent political developments and the BJP’s claims of winning 370 of the country’s 543 parliamentary seats, the party could face setbacks in key states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. In UP, which has 80 seats — the highest number of any state — the party could lose 20-35 seats as opposed to the 62 that it had won in the 2019 general election. Likewise, in Bihar, the BJP could secure 15-20 seats, it said. “The BJP is actively recruiting leaders from Congress, NCP, and Shiv Sena,” the editorial said. “(Lok Janshakti Party chief) Chirag Paswan’s situation in Bihar is uncertain after his uncle (Pashupati Kumar Paras) allied with the BJP and became a Union minister. (Opposition) efforts are underway to unite parties like the RJD, Congress, and the Communist outfits in Bihar to counter the BJP’s potential gains,” it said. CAA Following Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s announcement that its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) would be implemented later this year, Sahara’s 12 February editorial harked back to the nationwide protests against the law in 2019.Passed by Parliament in December that year, the CAA seeks to grant citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis, Christians, Buddhists, and Jains from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh who entered India before 31 December, 2014, without any document. Although notified in 2020, the law could not be implemented that year because the rules governing it were not framed then.Sahara’s editorial posed the question of why the law was being prioritised now, especially given its controversial history and delayed implementation. Meanwhile, Siasat’s 15 February editorial questioned the decision of Rajasthan’s BJP government to make Surya Namaskar — the sun salutation in yoga — compulsory in schools. The editorial drew parallels between this move and Karnataka’s 2022 hijab ban, saying that this move too was aimed at targeting Muslims. “Such mandates infringe on religious rights and are an attempt to promote Hindu ideology in educational institutions,” it said, adding that they were “unacceptable and violate the rights of Muslims”.Pakistan electionEditorials also commented on the political situation in Pakistan in the aftermath of the National Assembly election held earlier this month. The election threw up a hung house and following days of uncertainty, former prime minister Shehbaz Sharif is reportedly set to return as prime minister.   In its editorial on 12 February, Siasat warned that, given the situation, the country will soon begin to see horse trading. This editorial came days before Shehbaz, brother of Pakistan’s three-time PM Nawaz Sharif, was declared PM-elect.   “The situation is uncertain, signaling the beginning of a corrupt era. The process of buying and selling of National Assembly members will start, and the one who bids the most will win,” it said. “Moreover, support for Nawaz Sharif from the Pakistani military is becoming evident. It could be said that public opinion has once again been enslaved in Pakistan, and, no matter which government comes to power, calling it elected and representative may not be entirely accurate.”Similarly, Sahara’s 11 February editorial also commented on the influence of Pakistan’s powerful military on the election. “Despite having an Election Commission’s official role, it’s widely known to be under the influence of the establishment,” the editorial said, adding: “Like Bangladesh, Pakistan’s democracy struggles due to a consistent failure to prioritise civilian authority over military power.”(Edited by Uttara Ramaswamy)Also Read: BJP using Ram temple event to manipulate Hindu sentiments, unnerve Opposition, says Urdu press  Among other important news, the ongoing farmers’ protest for a law guaranteeing Minimum Support Price also got significant coverage, with editorials castigating the use of state force on peaceful protests.

This isn’t the solution to the problem.”On 13 February, Siasat carried a report on its front page titled ‘Kya Modi ke guroor ka phir sir hoga neecha?’ (Will Modi’s pride be broken yet again?). In this article, the newspaper covered the farmers’ ‘Delhi Chalo’ march and reported how police had heightened security around the national capital and how prohibitory orders had been imposed in the city. Also Read: ‘Mere claims without tangible outcomes can’t resolve poverty’ — Urdu press on NITI Aayog reportBihar politics The trust vote in the Bihar assembly and the removal of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Awadh Bihari Choudhary from the Speaker’s position also got prominent coverage this week. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who last month switched his allegiance back to the BJP-led NDA, won the trust vote amid an Opposition walkout.  In its editorial on 13 February, Siasat said that despite the recent political developments and the BJP’s claims of winning 370 of the country’s 543 parliamentary seats, the party could face setbacks in key states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. In UP, which has 80 seats — the highest number of any state — the party could lose 20-35 seats as opposed to the 62 that it had won in the 2019 general election. Likewise, in Bihar, the BJP could secure 15-20 seats, it said. “The BJP is actively recruiting leaders from Congress, NCP, and Shiv Sena,” the editorial said. “(Lok Janshakti Party chief) Chirag Paswan’s situation in Bihar is uncertain after his uncle (Pashupati Kumar Paras) allied with the BJP and became a Union minister. (Opposition) efforts are underway to unite parties like the RJD, Congress, and the Communist outfits in Bihar to counter the BJP’s potential gains,” it said. CAA Following Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s announcement that its controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) would be implemented later this year, Sahara’s 12 February editorial harked back to the nationwide protests against the law in 2019.Passed by Parliament in December that year, the CAA seeks to grant citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis, Christians, Buddhists, and Jains from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh who entered India before 31 December, 2014, without any document. Although notified in 2020, the law could not be implemented that year because the rules governing it were not framed then.Sahara’s editorial posed the question of why the law was being prioritised now, especially given its controversial history and delayed implementation. Meanwhile, Siasat’s 15 February editorial questioned the decision of Rajasthan’s BJP government to make Surya Namaskar — the sun salutation in yoga — compulsory in schools. The editorial drew parallels between this move and Karnataka’s 2022 hijab ban, saying that this move too was aimed at targeting Muslims. “Such mandates infringe on religious rights and are an attempt to promote Hindu ideology in educational institutions,” it said, adding that they were “unacceptable and violate the rights of Muslims”.Pakistan electionEditorials also commented on the political situation in Pakistan in the aftermath of the National Assembly election held earlier this month. The election threw up a hung house and following days of uncertainty, former prime minister Shehbaz Sharif is reportedly set to return as prime minister.   In its editorial on 12 February, Siasat warned that, given the situation, the country will soon begin to see horse trading. This editorial came days before Shehbaz, brother of Pakistan’s three-time PM Nawaz Sharif, was declared PM-elect.   “The situation is uncertain, signaling the beginning of a corrupt era. The process of buying and selling of National Assembly members will start, and the one who bids the most will win,” it said. “Moreover, support for Nawaz Sharif from the Pakistani military is becoming evident. It could be said that public opinion has once again been enslaved in Pakistan, and, no matter which government comes to power, calling it elected and representative may not be entirely accurate.”Similarly, Sahara’s 11 February editorial also commented on the influence of Pakistan’s powerful military on the election. “Despite having an Election Commission’s official role, it’s widely known to be under the influence of the establishment,” the editorial said, adding: “Like Bangladesh, Pakistan’s democracy struggles due to a consistent failure to prioritise civilian authority over military power.”(Edited by Uttara Ramaswamy)Also Read: BJP using Ram temple event to manipulate Hindu sentiments, unnerve Opposition, says Urdu press  A five-judge Constitution bench comprising CJI D.Y.

Asserting that India is no more a country to be led by others, rather it is a nation which has taken the mantle to lead the world, Singh said India has made a name for itself the world over, with its success stories in the form of the indigenously developed Covid vaccine and much-talked about Chandrayaan Mission. “Prime Minister Modi is India’s brand ambassador who has popularised Yoga, millets and traditional Indian remedies across the world,” he said, adding India has earned itself recognition as a propagator and a brand ambassador, with its traditional medicines and practices like Yoga becoming a panacea. The Union minister said that at the G20 Summit held in India last year, PM Modi proposed establishing a Global bio alliance to promote collaboration and sharing of best practices among the nations. “India has shed the tag of a fragile economy, and has now emerged as a fertile economy,” he said, adding that it is on its course to become the third largest economy in the world. Calling for collaboration among the emerging agri-start-ups and the industry, Singh said now is the time for greater integration. The era of silos is over. “The government has created an enabling ecosystem which must be optimised,” he suggested. Complimenting the organisers of the conference, Director General CSIR Dr N Kalaiselvi said the present day need in health care systems and drug formulations demand an integrated approach wherein the manufacturing of the drugs should be in integration with utilisation of the natural sources of drug molecules derived from plants. She emphasised that the conduct of the conference assumes much interest in light of the increased global alignment for use of phytopharmaceuticals. Earlier, Director CSIR-IIIM, Jammu Dr Zabeer Ahmed said the institute has been spearheading the scientific study, validation, and legalisation of phytopharmaceuticals and organising a conference on the futuristic theme and Ethnopharmacology for Development of Phytopharmaceutical Drugs and represents collective aspiration to push the boundaries of knowledge and innovation in the realm of research on traditional methods of healthcare and drug development from phytopharmaceuticals. “We reaffirm our determination to take a giant leap forward in our pursuit of transformative breakthroughs that will define the future of healthcare,” he said. He said more than 100 speakers from 20 different countries including the USA, United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, Ghana and India would be delivering their talks during the conference.

The minister said because of the Act East Policy, the country’s relationship with Bangladesh and Bhutan have seen a new era of cooperation in areas of trade, transit and water resources management.He said the Northeastern states are witnessing rapid development in road infrastructure, regional airways connectivity, railways, waterways and shipping, and internet connectivity.“The central government has taken the region to a high growth trajectory with the implementation of Act East Policy and the NE is acting as India’s bridge with ASEAN and SE countries,” he said.Patowary also highlighted how Northeastern states have reaped economic benefits due to closer ties with neighbouring countries.He added that use of Chittagong and Mongla ports in Bangladesh will further strengthen waterways connectivity in the Northeast and mutually benefit both countries.“The government of Assam is committed to transforming the state into an economic hub.

Previously, these goods were allowed only through Kolkata airport.“The continuing Red Sea crisis has already increased logistical costs for the exporters and it has also led to shift of export shipments from sea to air mode. At this crucial time, allowing Bangladeshi export cargo from Delhi Air Cargo Terminal will further increase the logistical challenges and increase the transportation cost for apparel exporters,” said Sudhir Sekhri, AEPC chairman, in a statement Thursday.Due to carrying capacity overload at the Delhi airport, airlines have allegedly begun charging three times the normal tariff to exporters over the past two months.According to industry estimates, air freight rates for US-bound goods, which were previously at Rs 150-160/kg, are now Rs 450/kg, while rates for Europe-bound goods have increased to Rs 300/kg from Rs 80-100/kg.Unlike exporters from India, those from Bangladesh can afford higher rates as they enjoy benefits from the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) in Europe and Western markets, AEPC spokesperson Sameer Pushp told ThePrint. GSP schemes remove import duties from products coming from developing countries.ThePrint reached the Indian commerce ministry through email, messages and calls on whether it would meet the demands of domestic exporters.

It’s a shared legacyRed Sea crisis and surge in cargoExporters argue that the Bangladeshi cargo is only worsening the strain on shipments caused by the Red Sea crisis, where Yemen’s Houthi rebels are attacking commercial ships amid the Israel-Hamas war.“The heart of this issue is the Red Sea crisis. Ships are being diverted and taking two-three weeks longer to reach their destination. Buyers are placing fewer orders from India than projected. They’re shifting from shipping to air routes at exporters’ cost,” Gautam Nair, head of Matrix Clothing Private Ltd, told ThePrint.“Bangladeshi shipments are only exacerbating the situation,” he added.On 11 February, Delhi Cargo Service Centre (DCSC), which operates Cargo Terminal-2 of Delhi airport, issued a circular stating that the main reasons for an increase in tendered cargo since the start of February were due to the Red Sea crisis and “transfer cargo for export originating from Dhaka”.The Bangladeshi cargo requires a dual method of screening, which leads to delays in handling and processing, it added.Cargo volumes surged in February, with a high of 781 tonnes against an average of 300-400 tonnes. The average number of pieces of cargo screened in January stood at 19,000 while the average pieces screened a day in February was 25,000, according to a Delhi Cargo Service Centre (DSCS) Terminal report released on 11 February.These are figures only for one of the two terminals at Delhi airport.‘Reciprocal gesture’The Indian government’s decision to allow the transshipment of Bangladesh exports via Delhi was widely viewed as a reciprocal move after Bangladesh allowed India access to Chattogram and Mongla ports by India for transit and transshipment of cargo last April.In 2022, during her visit to India, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina issued a joint statement with Prime Minister Narendra Modi under which it was agreed that India would allow Bangladesh to use land customs stations, airports and seaports within its territory for exporting goods.Such reciprocal policies have also been noted by Faruque Hassan, the president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), as an example of how the two neighbouring countries “do not compete” but rather “complement” each other, according to a report by Bangladeshi daily, The Business Standard.If India suspended the transshipment of Bangladeshi goods through Delhi, economists in Bangladesh say, it could be seen as contrary to what was agreed under the joint statement.“Bangladesh has also given India transit facilities through various land and coastal shipping agreements. It’s unlikely the circular will be reversed because it could be seen not only as protectionist measure but also contrary to providing reciprocal trade facilitation as agreed by the leaders of the two countries in the 2022 joint statement,” Mustafizur Rahman, a Distinguished Fellow at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), a Dhaka-based think tank, told ThePrint.(Edited by Richa Mishra)Also Read: Bangladesh thanks India for ‘standing by it’, backs country’s decision to fence border with Myanmar  Meanwhile, Bangladesh has grown into a garment powerhouse, manufacturing for major clothing brands like H&M, Zara, Tommy Hilfiger, Gap, Calvin Klein and Hugo Boss — giving stiff competition to their counterparts in India.Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC), India’s official body of apparel exporters, Thursday requested the Central Board Of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) to roll back its circular dated 7 February that allowed transshipment of Bangladesh export cargo to third countries through Delhi Air Cargo complex.

The military has been battling an expanding armed resistance since a 2021 coup toppled the democratically elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, and the junta describes the resistance fighters as “terrorists”, blaming them for destroying Myanmar’s peace and stability.The conscription plan, slated to start in April, will require all men aged 18 to 35 and women aged 18 to 27 to serve for up to two years, while specialists like doctors aged up to 45 must serve for three years. The service can be extended to a total of five years, according to state media.Ye Myo Hein, senior advisor to the United States Institute of Peace think-tank, assessed most military battalions are currently struggling to meet the even half the recommended troop strength of 200 soldiers. “There has been a notable decline in the number of officer enlistments as well,” he told Reuters. “Additionally, the loss of officers, including Brigadier Generals…have been significantly higher due to shrinking battalion sizes and decreasing rank-and-file soldiers.”Last year, Ye Myo Hein estimated the Myanmar military had around 70,000 combat soldiers, citing interviews with military deserters and defectors, analysis of military documents and  casualty counts.Anthony Davis, a security analyst with British-based Jane’s intelligence company, had estimated the total strength of the rebel ethnic armies at around 75,000 in 2021. The current size of the anti-junta resistance is now likely higher with the emergence of more resistance groups as the conflict drags on, analysts said.The Tatmadaw, as the military is known, has not publicly declared the size of its fighting force in recent years.Miemie Winn Byrd, an analyst who previously served in the U.S. army, said defections had risen sharply in the past few months, based on interviews with military battalion commanders and other soldiers who had deserted.“Myanmar’s military forces are fatigued and demoralised,” she said, adding that basic supplies such as food and equipment were in short supply.Former army captain Htet Myat, who defected in June 2021 and now helps other soldiers defect, told Reuters in December that some battalions only had around 130 soldiers. Htet Myat said he defected because he opposed the 2021 coup.The military’s battlefield defeats have lead to unprecedented public calls for Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing to step down three years after the junta took power from the civilian government.TROOPS SPREAD THINEven with the mandatory recruitment, the military may not be able to rapidly ramp up its manpower, said Crisis Group’s Horsey. “It does not have the organisational capability to train large numbers of new recruits simultaneously,” he added.A dozen people eligible to serve also told Reuters that they would rather leave the country than join the military. They all declined to be named citing security concerns.At its current strength, the military does not have the manpower to effectively fight opposition troops on multiple fronts, according to a December analysis by Andrew Selth, an adjunct professor at the Griffith Asia Institute.“The generals know how thinly spread their troops are, and how difficult it is to fight more than one major battle at the same time,” said Selth, who has studied Myanmar, particularly the military, for decades.“The use of air power, armour and artillery gives the junta certain advantages, but ultimately only troops on the ground can win back territory and exert its will over the population.”In the western region of Rakhine, where the military is fighting the Arakan Army (AA), troops have been pushed out of at least five towns, a spokesman for the ethnic armed group said.The military has not publicly commented on the loss of territory.“They couldn’t send backup troops in Rakhine battles,” AA spokesman Khine Thu Kha told Reuters via phone. “That means they don’t have enough forces.” (Reporting by Reuters Staff, Writing by Devjyot Ghoshal; editing by Miral Fahmy)Disclaimer: This report is auto generated from the Reuters news service.

They all declined to be named citing security concerns.At its current strength, the military does not have the manpower to effectively fight opposition troops on multiple fronts, according to a December analysis by Andrew Selth, an adjunct professor at the Griffith Asia Institute.“The generals know how thinly spread their troops are, and how difficult it is to fight more than one major battle at the same time,” said Selth, who has studied Myanmar, particularly the military, for decades.“The use of air power, armour and artillery gives the junta certain advantages, but ultimately only troops on the ground can win back territory and exert its will over the population.”In the western region of Rakhine, where the military is fighting the Arakan Army (AA), troops have been pushed out of at least five towns, a spokesman for the ethnic armed group said.The military has not publicly commented on the loss of territory.“They couldn’t send backup troops in Rakhine battles,” AA spokesman Khine Thu Kha told Reuters via phone. “That means they don’t have enough forces.” (Reporting by Reuters Staff, Writing by Devjyot Ghoshal; editing by Miral Fahmy)Disclaimer: This report is auto generated from the Reuters news service.

The investigations reveal that vulnerable foreign nationals are trafficked to India under the guise of employment opportunities. “Upon their transportation to Jammu and Kashmir, they are sold to fake and illegal human resource agencies/consultancies, who further exploit them under the garb of job opportunities such as domestic helpers, maids, and babysitters, often leading to sexual exploitation,” the official said. The official said this nefarious scheme is part of a broader conspiracy hatched by international terrorist organisations, in connivance with notorious trans-border human traffickers. “These groups facilitate the infiltration of foreign nationals across international borders, concealing their original identities with forged Indian documents with the ultimate aim to establish sleeper cells to aid, execute, or facilitate terrorist acts in the UT of Jammu and Kashmir,” the official added.

The Myanmar paramilitary personnel, army troops and civil officials fled their posts and offices in February first week from their bordering Rakhine state, many with weapons and after their arrival, they were disarmed and kept in the Border Guard Bangladesh custody. “They were extended makeshift refuge on humanitarian grounds as they crossed the border to save their lives. But no more intrusion will be allowed in future,” paramilitary Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) chief Major General Ashrafuzzaman Siddiqui told newspersons at the repatriation site.Show Full Article Dhaka, Feb 15 (PTI) Bangladesh on Thursday repatriated 330 of Myanmar’s paramilitary soldiers and civilians, more than a week after they fled their posts and took refuge in this country amid fierce clashes between government troops and insurgents.

But no more intrusion will be allowed in future,” paramilitary Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) chief Major General Ashrafuzzaman Siddiqui told newspersons at the repatriation site. Officials and witnesses said the repatriation took place through the sea under the supervision of BGB, aided by the Bangladesh Navy, coastguard and other law enforcement agencies while a delegation of Myanmar’s paramilitary Border Guard Police (BGP) received them. Myanmar BGP delegation leader, Lieutenant Colonel Myo Thura Naung received them at a makeshift canopy at the Inani beach after a roll call and identification by the junta-run country’s ambassador in Dhaka Aung Kyaw Moe. Out of the 330 Myanmar nationals, 302 were BGP personnel while others were regular military soldiers, immigration officials and their family members, who got onboard Bangladesh tourist cruisers at a navy jetty at the Inani beach. The cruise ships took them to the deep sea to be transferred to a Myanmar Navy ship. The five-member BGP delegation came to Bangladesh territory earlier on Thursday. Earlier, on February 5, two people, a Bangladeshi woman and a Rohingya man from Myanmar, were killed in Bangladesh as mortar shells fired from Myanmar landed in a village across the border amid escalated battles between Myanmar’s government troops and rebel Arakan Army. Bangladesh’s border with Myanmar stretches 271 kilometres, from the tri-point with India in the north to the Bay of Bengal in the south. Bangladesh played a critical role in over a million Muslim minority Rohingyas, who fled their home in Rakhine and took refuge in Bangladesh to evade persecution, particularly after a 2017 army crackdown. But the current crisis has little to do with the Rohingyas. The country won praise for the handling of the world’s biggest refugee crisis while Dhaka repeatedly sought their repatriation to their homeland in Rakhine saying the Rohingyas were causing economic, social, security and environmental problems. But Dhaka so far received little effective response from the Myanmar side for the Rohingya repatriation. Meanwhile, as the influx of Myanmar government soldiers continued for the third consecutive day, armed conflict in Myanmar also killed people inside Bangladesh and forced people in the frontier to flee their homes, Dhaka summoned the Myanmar envoy. Foreign minister Hassan Mahmud later said a strong note protest was handed over to the envoy due to the casualties and disturbances in Bangladesh caused by the armed conflicts on the Myanmar side of the border. “We told him, this is completely unacceptable,” Mahmud said while officials said the envoy assured Dhaka of conveying his government the Bangladesh protest.

Bangladesh played a critical role in over a million Muslim minority Rohingyas, who fled their home in Rakhine and took refuge in Bangladesh to evade persecution, particularly after a 2017 army crackdown. But the current crisis has little to do with the Rohingyas. The country won praise for the handling of the world’s biggest refugee crisis while Dhaka repeatedly sought their repatriation to their homeland in Rakhine saying the Rohingyas were causing economic, social, security and environmental problems. But Dhaka so far received little effective response from the Myanmar side for the Rohingya repatriation. Meanwhile, as the influx of Myanmar government soldiers continued for the third consecutive day, armed conflict in Myanmar also killed people inside Bangladesh and forced people in the frontier to flee their homes, Dhaka summoned the Myanmar envoy. Foreign minister Hassan Mahmud later said a strong note protest was handed over to the envoy due to the casualties and disturbances in Bangladesh caused by the armed conflicts on the Myanmar side of the border. “We told him, this is completely unacceptable,” Mahmud said while officials said the envoy assured Dhaka of conveying his government the Bangladesh protest.
