Their Indian ‘facilitator’ was also nabbed. Speaking to reporters in Agartala on Saturday, an official said a joint team of the Government Railway Police (GRP) and the Railway Police Force (RPF) detained the suspects at the Badharghat Railway station. They were about to board the Kolkata-bound Kanchanjunga Express. “We questioned them, and they admitted that they were from Bangladesh. Two Bangladeshi citizens had national identity cards from their country of origin and a mobile phone. The Indian tout had his documents, some Indian currency, etc. We have produced them before a local court,” the official said. The Bangladeshi nationals were identified as Billal Hossain, Sohel Miah, Ajijul Hakim, Samim Miah, and Hafizul Islam. While the Indian tout was identified as Runi Muqsid Khan from Maharashtra. During the preliminary investigation, Runi Muqsid Khan said he was involved in the garments business. On January 1, the BSF said in a statement that it arrested 744 people for illegally crossing the international border in Tripura in 2023, including 112 Rohingya migrants, 337 Bangladeshi nationals, and 295 Indians.",The Indian ‘tout’ was also held at Badharghat Railway station
bangladesh,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/sheikh-hasina-sworn-in-prime-minister-bangladesh-fifth-term-9105698/,Sheikh Hasina sworn in as prime minister of Bangladesh for fifth term,"January 11, 2024, 10:24 PM",2024-01-11,11-1-2024,"Sheikh Hasina was on Thursday sworn in as the prime minister of Bangladesh for the fifth term, days after her Awami League won an overwhelming majority in the general elections boycotted by the main opposition BNP and its allies. President Mohammad Shahabuddin administered the oath of office to 76-year-old Hasina at a ceremony joined by politicians, foreign diplomats, civil society figures and senior civil and military officials at Bangabhaban presidential palace here. She will serve as the 12th prime minister; her fourth consecutive term and fifth overall term. Hasina, the daughter of Bangladesh’s founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, has been ruling the strategically located South Asian nation since 2009. She is among the world’s longest-serving female heads of government. Following the prime minister, the new members of cabinet were sworn in by the president. Hasina’s party won 223 seats in the 300-member Parliament. Opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of ex-prime minister Khaleda Zia boycotted the elections after their demand for a non-party caretaker government to conduct the January 7 polls was rejected. Hasina formed her government for the straight fourth term. She has inducted 25 ministers and 11 state ministers in her Cabinet. “We have not got the (new) ministers and state ministers’ portfolios yet but it is expected to be announced later Thursday,” a cabinet division official told PTI. Hasina has dropped some heavyweights like foreign minister AK Abdul Momen, finance minister AHM Mostafa Kamal, planning minister Abdul Mannan, agriculture minister Abdur Razzak and commerce minister Tipu Munshi from her new Cabinet. Names of 13 junior ministers out of 18 state ministers in the outgoing government also did not appear in the new list and they included junior minister for foreign affairs Shahriar Alam. The new council of ministers list named 14 new faces as full ministers and seven state ministers though some of them were elevated as cabinet ministers. Samanta Lal Sen, a doctor specialized on burn wounds, emerged as a new face in the list of full ministers as a technocrat to the surprise of many as he was never known for political activism. Simin Hossain Rimi, the daughter of the first prime minister of Bangladesh Tazuddin Ahmed, is among the new faces named on the state ministers list. Bangladesh went to polls on Sunday, in which the ruling Awami League headed by Prime Minister Hasina won 223 seats; the Jatiya Party 11 seats; the Workers’ Party, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal and Bangladesh Kalyan Party one seat each; and independent candidates won 61 seats. India, China and Russia congratulated Hasina after her victory. All Far Eastern and Middle Eastern countries including Japan and Saudi Arabia also welcomed the ruling Awami League’s reelection. However, the Western nations, including the United States and the UK, which were insisting the Bangladesh election to be inclusive, and the United Nations expressed their reservations about the election.","Hasina, the daughter of Bangladesh's founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, has been ruling the strategically located South Asian nation since 2009."

The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), who participated in the 2018 polls but stayed away in 2014, boycotted the election after Hasina refused their demands to resign and allow a neutral authority to run the election. The daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, founding father of Bangladesh who was killed in an army coup in 1975 along with most members of their family, Hasina, 76, first became prime minister in 1996 and it will be her fifth term overall. In her past 15 years in power she has been credited with turning around the economy and the massive garments industry, winning international praise for sheltering Rohingya Muslims fleeing persecution in neighbouring Myanmar. Bangladeshis largely stayed away from Sunday’s general election, which was marred by violence. Turnout was about 40% when polls closed, said chief election commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal, compared with over 80% in the last election in 2018. The ruling Awami League party won 167 seats out of 227 seats with the outcome of the rest of the seats still to be unannounced, according to unofficial results released by the Election Commission. Hasina herself bagged 249,962 votes from her constituency Gopalganj, about 165 kilometres (103 miles) from capital Dhaka, while her nearest rival secured just 469 votes. “I am trying my best to ensure that democracy should continue in this country,” Hasina said on Sunday after casting her vote, adding that her only accountability was to Bangladesh citizen. She has instructed party leaders and supporters not to bring out any victory processions or indulge in celebrations, said Awami League’s general secretary Obaidul Quader. Polls were held for 299 directly elected parliamentary seats with close to 120 million voters choosing from nearly 2,000 contestants. Election to one seat will be held at a later date after an independent contestant died ahead of the vote due to natural causes. Among the ruling party winners were former Bangladesh cricket captains Shakib Al Hasan and Mashrafe Mortaza. Independent candidates, many of them Awami League party members of various ranks, won 49 seats. BNP has accused the ruling party of propping up ‘dummy’ independent candidates to try to make the election look credible. Awami League has denied the accusation. The BNP called a two-day strike nationwide through Sunday, asking people to shun the election, and said the low turnout was a success for their boycott call. Hasina has accused the opposition of instigating anti-government protests that have rocked Dhaka since late October and killed at least 14 people. Her critics accuse Hasina of authoritarianism, human rights violations, crackdowns on free speech and suppression of dissent. The economy has also slowed sharply since the Russia-Ukraine war pushed up prices of fuel and food imports, forcing Bangladesh to turn last year to the International Monetary Fund for a bailout of $4.7 billion.","The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), who participated in the 2018 polls but stayed away in 2014, boycotted the election after Hasina refused their demands to resign and allow a neutral authority to run the election."

Despite a decisive victory in the general elections, the electoral process faced challenges, including sporadic violence and a boycott by the primary opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). She has clinched the Gopalganj-3 seat for the eighth time since 1986 with 249,965 votes as against closest rival M Nizam Uddin Lashkar from the Bangladesh Supreme Party who has secured just 469 votes, bdnews24 reported. The ruling Awami League candidates are leading in most of the seats, according to the results so far. Earlier, the counting of votes started after the polling ended in the general elections. Bangladeshis on Sunday turned up in low numbers to cast their votes for polls. The counting of votes is currently underway, and results are expected by Monday. According to the Election Commission’s initial estimates, the voter turnout is around 40 per cent but the figure could change after the final count. This stands in contrast to the overall turnout of over 80% recorded in the previous election held in 2018. Meanwhile, voting was cancelled at three centres — one in Narsingdi and two in Narayanganj. As per reports, the Election Commission has ordered the arrest of Industries Minister Nurul Majid Mahmud Humayun’s son on charges of electoral fraud in Narsingdi. PM Sheikh Hasina on Sunday expressed her indifference to the approval of the polls by foreign media, emphasising that her primary concern is the acceptance of the election by the people of the country. She made these remarks following the casting of her vote. “Whether people accept this election or not it is important to me. So, I don’t care about their (foreign media) acceptance. No matter what did the terrorist party say or not?” PM Hasina said. Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan, meanwhile, on Sunday said that BNP abstained from participating in the parliamentary election due to the anticipation of an expected defeat. “The BNP has taken a strategy of boycotting the election with various excuses, various demands. They participated in the 2018 election and got some parliamentary seats, but this year they did not participate knowing they would be defeated,” Khan, a senior leader of tej ruling Awami League, was quoted as saying by the Dhaka Tribune newspaper. Bangladesh has around 20 million voters, while nearly 2,000 candidates are in the fray for the 300 parliamentary seats. There are 436 independent candidates — the most since 2001. The boycott by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its smaller allies has put a blot on the credibility of elections, with the BNP alleging that the Awami League has propped up “dummy” candidates as independents to try to make the election look democratic, reported Reuters. Hasina’s bloc has denied the claim. BNP’s current leader, the exiled Tarique Rahman has also called the process a “sham”. The BNP wanted the election to be held under a “caretaker government” to ensure a fair and unbiased process, however, Hasina did not relent. Amid tensions, the BNP, which also boycotted polls in 2014, has urged people to boycott the polls and called a two-day nationwide strike till Sunday night. Besides the scepticism around the fairness of the electoral process and Hasina’s autocratic tendencies, the state of the economy is another factor in the elections as well. While Hasina has been credited with taking Bangladesh’s economy to a good place, the cost of living has jumped as the country struggles to pay for costly energy imports amid weakening domestic currency and depleting dollar reserves. Hasina’s message for India In a video message on voting day. Sheikh Hasina extended her wishes for India and highlighted India’s support during the Liberation War in 1971. She said, ”We are very lucky…India is our trusted friend. During our Liberation War, they supported us…After 1975, when we lost our whole family…they gave us shelter. So our best wishes to the people of India,” reported ANI. The PM also appeared to vote on Sunday, following which she spoke to Reuters and said: “Bangladesh is a sovereign country and people are my power.. I am trying my best to ensure that democracy should continue in this country.” On Friday, an apparent arson fire on a train in Bangladesh’s capital killed four people and added to the country’s extreme tension ahead of the parliamentary elections. The BNP has demanded a UN-supervised investigation into the incident which it described as a “pre-planned” act of sabotage, reported PTI. Consequently, troops have been stationed across Bangladesh to maintain peace, with around 800,000 police, paramilitary and police auxiliaries guarding polling booths on Sunday. — With Reuters, PTI inputs","According to the Election Commission's initial estimates, the voter turnout is around 40 per cent but the figure could change after the final count."

Incumbent Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her Awami League (AL) are set to return to power for a fourth straight term, as the main opposition, Khaleda Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), boycotts the elections.  BNP’s current leader, the exiled Tarique Rahman has called the process a “sham” with a “predetermined outcome”. The BNP wanted the election to be held under a “caretaker government” to ensure a fair and unbiased process. But Hasina did not relent.  Notably, the BNP’s qualms about the fairness of Bangladesh’s electoral process have historical baggage. Very few elections in Bangladesh have been considered free and fair by all parties involved. In fact, no election held under a partisan government has been unblemished from accusations of impropriety. Here is a brief timeline of Bangladesh’s elections. 1971: Bangladesh is born at the end of the War of Liberation; Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s Awami League leads the struggle. 1973: First elections are held; overwhelming victory for the AL amid allegations of rigging in some places. 1974: Mujib bans opposition parties and effectively turns Bangladesh to one-party system. 1975: Mujib is assassinated in a military coup along with most of his family; two daughters Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana, who were abroad at the time, survive and seek asylum in New Delhi; Ziaur Rahman, a military general, effectively takes over. 1979: Ziaur’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party wins elections; Awami League alleges massive rigging, rejects results. 1981: Ziaur assassinated; his deputy Abdus Sattar takes over and wins general elections. 1982: HM Ershad, army chief, leads another coup. 1986: Ershad’s Jatiya Party wins elections amidst an abysmal turnout; BNP, now under Khaleda Zia, Ziaur’s wife, boycotts polls but AL contests; most do not see the results as legitimate. 1988: Another election held amid calls for Ershad’s removal; boycotted by both AL and BNP, with Khaleda and Hasina leading protests together. 1990: Ershad resigns amid massive protests; a caretaker government takes over. 1991: BNP wins narrow majority in what was seen as fairest elections yet; Khaleda becomes PM, AL sits in opposition. 1996: BNP refuses to appoint caretaker government and wins controversial elections with most parties boycotting; however, the government lasts merely 12 days; elections held again, this time under caretaker government; AL wins and Hasina comes to power for the first time. 2001: BNP wins elections under caretaker government; notably, gives cabinet ministries to Islamist Jamaat; electoral violence targets Bangladesh’s Hindu minority. 2006: Impasse as BNP and AL cannot decide caretaker government; President Iajuddin Ahmed, backed by the Army, declares himself leader. 2007: Army-backed caretaker government arrests Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina on charges of corruption. 2008: Elections finally held under caretaker government; Sheikh Hasina and AL-led Grand Alliance win landslide victory. 2011: Hasina abolishes provisions for caretaker government citing previous experience in 2006-07; cracks down on opposition. 2014: Khaleda put under house arrest; BNP and opposition parties boycott, elections; AL again wins by a landslide. 2018: AL canters to landslide victory even as reports of violence, voter suppression, and rigging mar elections again; BNP again boycotts elections.","Not a single election in Bangladesh, held under a partisan government, has ever been seen as legitimate. As Bangladesh heads to polls once again, here is a brief timeline of elections in Bangladesh."
bangladesh,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/bangladesh-elections-pm-sheikh-hasina-bnp-9098251/,Bangladesh to hold general elections tomorrow; PM Hasina poised to win 4th consecutive term,"January 06, 2024, 10:52 PM",2024-01-06,6-1-2024,"Bangladesh will go to the polls on Sunday in which Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is expected to win a fourth straight term in the absence of the main Opposition BNP which on Saturday began a 48-hour nationwide strike against the “illegal government” amidst sporadic violence. The election commission said it has nearly completed the preparedness for voting in all constituencies across the country and also ensured security arrangements. Bangladesh has a 300-member Parliament. Election in one constituency has been postponed after an independent candidate died of natural causes. A total of 119.6 million registered voters are eligible to vote at Sunday’s polls in more than 42,000 polling stations, according to the country’s Election Commission. More than 1,500 candidates from 27 political parties are contesting in the election besides 436 independent candidates. Over 100 foreign observers, including three from India, will monitor the 12th general election, which is being held under tight security. Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Kazi Habibul Awal has warned that if there are any irregularities in the upcoming national polls, the election will be called off altogether. Addressing the nation on Saturday evening, he said that vote rigging, ballot snatching, money transactions, and possible use of muscle power in favour of any candidate or candidates will be strictly resisted. If evidence is found, their candidature will be cancelled immediately. If necessary, voting in the centre or constituency will be completely suspended, he was quoted as saying by the Dhaka Tribune. The election commission said voting will start at 8 am and will end at 5 pm. The results are expected to start flowing from early on January 8. Prime Minister Hasina’s ruling Awami League is expected to win for a straight fourth time as the main Opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of former premier Khaleda Zia, 78, who is under house arrest as a convict of graft charges, boycotted the polls. Hasina, 76, in a nationally televised address this week has urged the pro-democratic and law-abiding parties not to fuel ideas that “disrupt” the country’s constitutional process. The BNP has called for a 48-hour nationwide general strike which began at 6 am and will end at 6 am on Monday.
The number of vehicles on the street is fewer compared to other days, but despite fear of arson attacks, public vehicles were plying the streets. The 27 political parties that are contesting the elections include the opposition Jatiya Party (JAPA). The rest are members of the ruling Awami League-led coalition, which experts dub as “satellite parties.” As part of its vote boycott campaign, BNP has been calling countrywide general strikes. It has enforced intermittent transport blockades and strikes for the past three months. The party has been claiming no election under the incumbent government would be fair and credible. BNP spokesman Ruhul Kabir Rizvi said the strike was aimed at pressing for their demands for “resignation of the illegal government, establishment of a non-party neutral government and release of all party leaders and activists from prison”. Ahead of the elections, Hasina’s government arrested tens of thousands of rival politicians and supporters, a move which rights groups have condemned as an attempt to paralyse the Opposition. Authorities deployed Army troops across the country two days ago “in aid of civil administration” to maintain peace and order during the voting. Despite the strict security arrangements, unidentified people carried homemade bomb and arson attacks in empty polling centres in four out of 64 administrative districts, while BNP activists clashed with police in another district, leaving five people wounded on Friday. At least 14 arson attacks were reported in 16 hours till 9:30 am Saturday, according to Fire Service statistics.
At least four people were killed when a passenger train was torched by arsonists near Dhaka on Friday night. The BNP has demanded a UN-supervised investigation into the incident which it described as a “pre-planned” act of sabotage. Detectives said they arrested eight persons, including Dhaka south city unit BNP joint convener Nabi Ullah Nabi, for their involvement in setting fire to the Benapole Express. They claimed to have found involvement of the BNP and the activists of the Jubo Dal, the youth wing of the party, in last night’s attack. BNP Senior Joint Secretary General Ruhul Kabir Rizvi on Saturday said the government was playing with fire to make political gains by blaming the Opposition. “This government out and out from head to neck is corrupt… This is not a democratic government. Development cannot be there without democracy. People’s participation must be there…We are holding a peaceful movement. We never believe in violence and destroying people’s property,” Nitai Roy Chowdhury, Vice Chairman of BNP, said. Awami League and its candidates are waging a campaign for higher voter turnout. Some observers say the ruling party wants to establish a narrative that the BNP is no longer relevant in Bangladesh’s democracy. Political science professor and analyst Harunur Rashid said he feared Bangladesh might need to wait for an indefinite period to witness a congenial political atmosphere because of the highly conflicting nature between the two major parties. Hasina has been in power since 2009 and won the last election in December 2018, in a poll marred by deadly violence and accusations of poll rigging. The BNP boycotted the 2014 election but joined the one in 2018, which party leaders later said was a mistake, alleging the voting was marred with widespread rigging and intimidation. BNP’s boycott announcement this time, however, initially posed a challenge to Hasina on the legitimacy of the January 7 polls as JAPA also expressed its reluctance to join the fray but agreed to participate as the ruling party decided to spare them 26 seats. Awami League also left six seats to its partners in the 14-party ruling alliance while Hasina encouraged independent and rebel candidates to contest to make the polling participatory and to avoid the new parliament being branded a one-party institution. Senior BNP leader Abdul Moyeen Khan on Friday called the government efforts “childish”, proving its “political bankruptcy”. Analysts and watchdogs, however, said the country of 170 million was heading for virtual one-party rule, while many voters said they found no charm in voting this time as the polling was set to reelect the incumbent government.
Hasina has presided over one of the world’s fastest-growing economies in South Asia in the past 15 years. However, the economy faced turmoil in mid-2022 following a global economic slowdown, forcing her government to desperately seek the International Monetary Fund’s support as the foreign reserves depleted as an energy crisis and high inflation triggered a balance of payments crisis. Many fear that a fourth straight term for Hasina would worsen the economic situation, deepening their despair.
The polls have sharpened the country’s existing political divides. Many experts say that economic stability and geopolitics are likely to emerge as major challenges for the new government alongside domestic politics. “The issue of economic stability will be the major challenge. The new government will also face new dynamics of geopolitics,” Debopriya Bhattacharya of the economic and political watchdog Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) told PTI. He said the government must take effective steps to kick off the growth rate, tame inflation, check corruption and money laundering and revitalise the dwindling foreign exchange reserve through structural reforms while the new government would have to rally enough mastery to face the challenges. Bangladesh under the current government played a critical role in the Rohingya issue and won praise for the handling of the world’s biggest refugee crisis. Over a million Rohingyas took shelter in the South Asian country after fleeing a 2017 Army crackdown at their homeland in Myanmar. Hasina is also credited with skilfully negotiating the rival interests of India and China, as Bangladesh is virtually sandwiched between the two feuding Asian giants.",Bangladesh has a 300-member Parliament. Election in one constituency has been postponed after an independent candidate died of natural causes.

Unknown arsonists set fire to the Nischinta Para Government Primary School around 4:30 am in the Patenga EPZ area of Chittagong on Saturday, officials said. “Arsonists set the school’s headmaster’s room on fire. New books which were kept in the room were burnt,” Shakila Soltana, Deputy Commissioner of CMP Port Division, told The Daily Star. “Police are on the spot and investigating the incident,” she said. A fire was also reported at another school being used as a polling station in Gazipur city. Authorities say the initial signs point to arson in both incidents. Arsonists allegedly set fire to a cupboard in the office room of East Chandana Government Primary School, destroying books and documents inside, according to Abdullah-al-Arefin, deputy assistant director of Gazipur Fire Service. Emergency workers from Joydebpur and Gazipur Chowrasta fire stations subsequently extinguished the blaze. Meanwhile, other five schools that are designated polling centres and 10 election camps came under arson attacks between Thursday and Friday in six districts. No casualties or injuries were reported at the time of the incidents. Police are investigating the incident to trace the criminals, an official said.","Arsonists allegedly set fire to a cupboard in the office room of East Chandana Government Primary School, destroying books and documents inside, according to Abdullah-al-Arefin, deputy assistant director of Gazipur Fire Service."
bangladesh,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/thousands-opposition-activists-languish-prison-bangladesh-gears-up-national-election-9097890/,Thousands of opposition activists languish in prison as Bangladesh gears up for national election,"January 06, 2024, 04:08 PM",2024-01-06,6-1-2024,"Fazlur Rahman died on a hospital floor with his hands and legs still cuffed, his son Mohammad said, his voice breaking while recalling his father’s final moments. Rahman, 63, was one of thousands of opposition activists who were arrested in the months leading to Sunday’s parliamentary election amid a sweeping polarized political culture. The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, led by former premier Khaleda Zia, said Rahman was one of 10 members who died in police custody. According to his family, he was arrested on Oct. 25 outside the tea stall he ran and taken to jail. He fell sick and was later transferred to a hospital where he died over a week ago, they said. Rahman’s arrest came three days before a massive opposition rally turned violent, leaving at least 11 dead and nearly a hundred injured. His family believed he was targeted for being an outspoken BNP supporter for the last 35 years. “My father was with the BNP, which is why they took him,” Mohammad said, “if he dies, BNP’s name will vanish from our neighborhood.” The BNP has accused Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government of a major crackdown targeting its supporters and opposition politicians on what they say are trumped-up charges in the lead-up to the polls. They claimed that over 20,000 of their members have been jailed in recent months. However, government officials argued the figure to be much lower and that arrests were made not because of political affiliations but rather specific criminal charges such as arson. Attorney General A.M. Amin Uddin told The Associated Press over the phone Friday that between 2,000 and 3,000 people have been arrested. The country’s law minister told the BBC this week that 10,000 have been arrested. The figures remain unclear. CIVICUS, a nonprofit that tracks civic freedoms around the world, recently downgraded Bangladesh to “closed,” the worst rating that it could assign, along with China and Venezuela, following the latest crackdown on opposition supporters. “We’ve seen many of them being arbitrarily arrested and many of them are facing what we consider fabricated charges,” said Josef Benedict, a researcher with a focus on South Asia at CIVICUS. Rahman’s family said he was arrested in connection to a case dating back to 2022.The clampdown has raised questions about the legitimacy of the upcoming election. The BNP and other opposition parties had previously announced a boycott of the election, saying they could not trust the current administration to run it fairly. They repeatedly demanded Hasina’s resignation and for a caretaker government to oversee the election. The move has all but guaranteed Hasina, the country’s longest-serving leader, to extend her 15-year-long rule and clinch a fifth term in power. Rights groups have called the polls a farce, and fear that it follows a pattern. In 2018, Hasina’s Awami League-led alliance won 96% of the 300 seats in parliament amid widespread allegations of vote-rigging, which authorities denied. And in 2014, she came to power after a boycott by all major opposition parties. Instead of the BNP, smaller opposition parties and over 400 independent candidates — including scores from the Awami League itself — are participating. The government has invited international observers and defended the polls as fair and democratic, but critics say the aim is to make them look competitive instead. The recent targeting of the BNP has also reignited concerns of alleged enforced disappearances of opposition members and critics under the Hasina government, said Benedict, the researcher at CIVICUS. In August, Human Rights Watch said Bangladesh’s security forces have committed over 600 enforced disappearances since 2009, when Hasina came to power for the second time. The figures, based on Bangladeshi human rights monitors, show that nearly 100 remain missing. The government has consistently denied the accusations but has refused to work with the U.N. to investigate the disappearances. In 2022, Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan dismissed these concerns and said that those who went missing might be in hiding, and often return after a few days. That hasn’t been the case for Sajedul Islam, a BNP local politician, who has been missing for over 10 years, said Sanjida, his sister. His family said he was picked up by agents of Bangladesh’s Rapid Action Battalion — a special security force unit — on 4 Dec. 2013, just days before the 2014 general election. Over 20 people working at the construction site from where Islam was taken saw agents dressed in the black RAB uniform tying his hands before bundling him into a van, the family said. “For as long as we live, I will keep saying, ‘bring my brother back because he is my family. He is my blood,’” Sanjida said. Rights groups have long accused RAB of extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and human rights violations, sparking the U.S. government to impose sanctions on the elite paramilitary force in 2021.While this helped bring down the number of such incidents, Islam’s sister said they have struggled to push authorities to investigate her brother’s disappearance. “He was a strong organizer for the BNP in our neighborhood, he was popular and people listened to him – I think that’s why he was targeted,” Sanjida said. Political observers say such cases illustrate how the bitter rivalry between Hasina’s Awami League and the BNP led by Zia, who is ailing and under house arrest, has polarized Bangladeshi politics — and its citizens — for decades. Hasina has often accused the BNP of courting hardline extremists that her party, which calls itself moderate and secular, had worked to stamp out, while Zia’s BNP accuses the Awami League of using oppressive tactics to stay in power. The decades-long feud has deeply fractured the political landscape in Bangladesh, where the two main parties are marred by a history of electoral violence and a politics of retribution. When the BNP was last in power, from 2001-2006, rights groups and observers detailed how political and security conditions deteriorated in Bangladesh. In 2004, a grenade attack on a rally led by Hasina killed over 20 people, and she narrowly escaped. The country saw nearly daily bombings throughout 2005, according to a Human Rights Watch report at the time, which also accused the then-BNP government of widespread rights abuses. This week in the capital, Dhaka, people who said they suffered burn injuries during protests by the BNP in October, took to the streets. Authorities at the time said they arrested scores of BNP members for stoking violence and burning vehicles. They have since blamed numerous arson attacks on the opposition, which BNP has denied, saying the accusations were politically motivated and aimed at quashing their supporters as the election approaches. For Mohammad, who believes his father died because of supporting the BNP, this election doesn’t exist. “After seeing my father’s condition, I will never vote as long as this government is here,” he said.","The BNP has accused Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government of a major crackdown targeting its supporters and opposition politicians on what they say are trumped-up charges in the lead-up to the polls. They claimed that over 20,000 of their members have been jailed in recent months."
bangladesh,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/apparent-arson-on-a-train-in-bangladesh-kills-ahead-of-tense-sunday-election-9097406/,Apparent arson on a train in Bangladesh kills 4 ahead of tense Sunday election,"January 06, 2024, 07:34 AM",2024-01-06,6-1-2024,"An apparent arson fire on a train in Bangladesh’s capital killed four people late Friday and added to the country’s extreme tension ahead of Sunday’s parliamentary elections that the opposition is seeking to boycott and disrupt with a general strike. The fire rapidly raced through four coaches in the passenger train in what one police official called an attack aimed at scaring people ahead of the voting, though authorities did not immediately name any individuals or groups as suspects. Bangladesh frequently has violence surrounding elections, and Sunday’s voting comes amid an increasingly polarized political culture led by two powerful women — current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and former premier Khaleda Zia, an opposition leader currently under house arrest. Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party and other opposition groups are boycotting, saying elections wouldn’t be free or fair under Hasina. They had demanded she step aside and let a neutral caretaker government administer the polling, but her government insisted there was no provision in the constitution for such a move. The fire on the train broke out as it was moving toward Dhaka’s main railway station about 9 p.m., Rakibul Hasan, a duty officer of the Fire Service and Civil Defense, told The Associated Press by phone. At least four bodies were recovered from inside the train, police told reporters at the scene. Mahid Uddin, an additional police commissioner with the Dhaka Metropolitan Police, said the fire was “clearly an act of sabotage” aimed at scaring people ahead of the election. He did not name any political party or groups as suspects, but said police would seek those responsible. Seven firefighting units were sent to the scene to douse the blaze, Hasan said. Campaigning for the elections officially came to an end Friday morning. The Election Commission announced polling would be held in 299 constituencies out of 300 across the country on Sunday. The election in one constituency was postponed after an independent candidate died of natural causes. Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, a senior joint secretary general in Zia’s party, has urged people not to vote on Sunday and called for a 48-hour general strike beginning 6 a.m. on Saturday and ending 6 a.m. on Monday. On Friday morning, Rizvi led more than 100 opposition leaders and activists who were holding sticks and chanting anti-government slogans as they marched in the capital’s Karwan Bazar area.“People will not accept this illegal election. People will not accept this election of looters,” Rizvi said during the march. Hasina addressed the nation in a last televised campaign speech Thursday night, urging people to head to ballot stations. “If I have made any mistakes along the way, I ask your forgiveness. If I can form the government again, I will get a chance to correct the mistakes. Give me an opportunity to serve you,” she said. Earlier on Thursday, Hasina, addressing a huge campaign rally at Fatullah near Dhaka, urged all to maintain peace across the country. At least three people have been killed in violence attributed to political clashes since the campaign officially began Dec. 18. Bangladesh has a history of violence during elections and this year’s election is drawing international attention. The U.N. Secretary-General’s Associate Spokeswoman Florencia Soto Nino in New York said Wednesday: “We’re watching the process closely, and we hope that all elections happen in a transparent and organized manner.” Critics have accused Hasina of systemically suffocating the opposition by implementing repressive security measures. Zia’s party claimed that more than 20,000 opposition supporters have been arrested. The government said those figures were inflated and denied arrests were made due to political leanings, but rather for criminal charges such as arson and vandalism.Nearly 1.6 million people — half of them security personnel — will oversee the election, with 119.1 million registered voters eligible to vote in more than 42,000 polling stations, the commission said. Troops have also been deployed across the country to assist when needed under the supervision of magistrates, a common practice in Bangladesh during general elections.The Election Commission said Thursday that about 300 foreign observers, more than 70 of them are foreign journalists have been authorized to monitor and cover the election.","The fire rapidly raced through four coaches in the passenger train in what one police official called an attack aimed at scaring people ahead of the voting, though authorities did not immediately name any individuals or groups as suspects."
bangladesh,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bangladesh-elections-tug-of-war-islamic-fundamentalism-democracy-9095409/,Bangladesh isn’t Pakistan: Elections matter,"January 06, 2024, 10:20 AM",2024-01-06,6-1-2024,"The elections this weekend in Bangladesh, the first in a series of polls in 2024 across the world, will be significant. Unlike Pakistan, where the army will continue to rule irrespective of the electoral outcome, the Bangladesh elections can consolidate democratic practices and institutions, bring about a progressive development agenda and fuller participation in regional and global affairs. The support of the international community will be crucial for such an outcome. The ruling Grand Alliance, led by Sheikh Hasina of Awami League (AL), seeking a fourth successive term, has delivered on economic growth, infrastructure development, social support network, improvement in SDGs and the fight against terrorism in its 15 years of governance. However, popular support declined when the nation’s post-Covid recovery was impacted by the Ukraine war. It led to a macro-economic crisis, inflation and unemployment, and needed an IMF bailout. To compound the challenges, the Opposition campaigned vigorously for a caretaker government, failing which it threatened to boycott the polls. More worrisome for the government was criticism from the USA and Europe that called for free and fair elections, suggesting that processes were not democratic. For AL, these developments sought to undermine the legitimacy of the electoral outcome. Caretaker government Rather than debating on substantive issues, the single-point agenda of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) was to question who should conduct the elections. It insisted that AL step down and hand over power to a caretaker government. The experience of a neutral caretaker government, which began on an experimental basis in 1991, has been mixed. In 1996, the 13th Constitutional Amendment introduced the provision of a caretaker government as a compromise, to sustain democracy because of the deep mistrust between the political forces. In 2006, the caretaker government overstayed and even imprisoned political leaders from both sides. In 2011, the 15th Constitutional Amendment did away with caretaker governments and the Election Commission’s role in the electoral process was strengthened, as per Supreme Court rulings. When AL did not relent, the BNP decided to boycott the 2024 elections but continued to stage protests in the hope of stalling the process. Electoral violence Violence has been a feature of elections in Bangladesh with its history of assassinations that created deep mistrust between AL and BNP. It came in the way of dialogue and consensus and led to zero-sum options. In 2014, the Opposition boycotted the elections on the caretaker issue. In 2018, it contested the elections, but amidst allegations of electoral violations, the ruling alliance received an overwhelming mandate. The Opposition BNP entered the fray in 2023 with a depleted organisation, a weakened leadership in detention or overseas and dissension within the ranks. Its strategy of agitation to stall the elections led to further arrests of opposition workers. Many BNP local leaders wanted to contest elections, despite a diktat to boycott, and several broke away to form new parties. This reaffirmed the importance of electoral politics and the marginalisation of those who would not join elections. Islamist forces have been on the fringes of electoral processes. Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami (Jamaat), Bangladesh Islami Chhatrashibir (Shibir) and other Islamic parties aligned with the BNP were barred from contesting elections following court rulings — and their leaders were sentenced for war crimes committed during the liberation war. AL had courted certain Islamic groups to expand its vote base. Breakaway Islamic groups, including from Jamaat, formed new parties that were recognised by the Election Commission. This new trend of the mainstreaming of Islamist forces will need monitoring. External environment Bangladesh was sensitive to the criticism from the US and Europe about its democratic process. Not only has the US questioned its ability to hold free and fair elections but it also imposed visa restrictions on those who obstructed free and fair elections. The government feared that such criticism might come in the way of its larger aspirations for economic growth and globalisation. So while it gave no quarter to the opposition parties within Bangladesh, it sought to reassure foreign critics about its intention and ability to conduct the polls with high participation and representation and invited foreign observers to witness the promise of free and fair elections. In recent years, Bangladesh has grown rapidly as an emerging economy with great potential. It adopted a balanced foreign policy, built on close neighbourly relations with India, investments and imports from China, exports to the US and Europe, development assistance from Japan, energy ties with Russia, and recognised the importance of Saudi Arabia, UAE and Turkey. Bangladesh’s aspirations to be a middle-developed economy will need such a broad range of external partnerships. Quest for democracy and identity Bangladesh was born in a liberation war, pushing for democracy and resisting genocide against Bengalis by Pakistan. Politics in Bangladesh, since its inception, was split between those who fought for liberation from Pakistan and those who remained sympathetic to Pakistan and its military-led politics influenced by religious fundamentalists. The struggle within Bangladesh has been for an open, secular and democratic society versus Islamic fundamentalism. On the economic front, both sides have sought growth, but the methods and beneficiaries have varied. The outcome of this struggle now will impact society and polity, with the possibility of political unrest and the export of extremism, if society falls prey to religious fundamentalism and sponsors of terrorism. The practice and tradition of democracy have been evolving in Bangladesh. The Opposition was not helpful in the development of democratic traditions. The state often clamped down on political opposition, civil society and media. Yet, to balance that, it has shown a positive momentum in the growth of democracy, establishment of institutions, wider gender representation and confidence in electoral politics. It is important to understand that Bangladesh chose democracy, unlike its estranged twin Pakistan. A confident and rising Bangladesh will be an important member of the global community, a partner for free and open societies and the spread of democracy.

He said the police had recovered from them two SIM cards, one issued in India and the other in Bangladesh.

Stating that she wants the 12th parliamentary election to be held peacefully, Hasina, also the president of the ruling Awami Party said, “We will take part in the January 7 election with our party’s electoral symbol Boat. Go early to the polling centres to cast a vote (for boat) to show the world that we can hold the election in a free, fair and neutral manner.” “Various conspiracies are being hatched to foil the polls. Many are also involved internationally. They work to bring a third party to power in Bangladesh—we will give a befitting reply to the conspiracies through the January 7 election,” Hasina said while addressing an election rally at Tungipara, about 170 km southwest of Dhaka. “What can the third party do? They can’t do any development in the country. You had seen what they did in 2007,” Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS), the country’s national news agency, quoted Hasina as saying. Amid increasing violence, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, has announced that it would boycott the election. BNP had boycotted the 2014 election too but took part in the 2018 polls. Earlier in the year, the US and other major Western countries had called for dialogue between the ruling Awami League and the opposition to ensure an inclusive and credible election, which however, saw no headway visibly due to reluctance by both sides. On Saturday, the BSS reported that Hasina was accompanied by her younger sister Sheikh Rehana to the rally grounds at Tungipara, where she waved the national flag to a roaring response from her supporters who had gathered to listen to her. Hasina, 76, is the longest serving prime minister of Bangladesh with first term from 1996 to 2001, and three consecutive terms from 2009 to 2014, 2014 to 2019 and 2019 till date. Terming the opposition BNP as “a terrorist party” and the Jamaat-e-Islami (Jamaat) as “an organisation of war criminals,” prime minister Hasina said they have “no capability to take the country forward.” Hasina also came down heavily on the alleged criminal acts by the BNP-Jamaat men, likening it to killings of children and women in Gaza’s hospitals, and said that if her party is voted back to power, it will ensure that such criminality will end. This was in reference to the alleged atrocities committed by party men belonging to BNP, whose acting chairman Tarique Rahman, a businessman turned politician, is in exile in the UK. “If Allah wants and we can come (to power) by winning the next election, it won’t be allowed that he (Tarique) will give order to harm and kill the people of our country, staying in London. If necessary, he would be brought from there (to the country) and given punishment,” BSS quoted Hasina as saying. The AL chief said her party wants peace to continue and the country’s development be strengthened while the BNP-Jamaat clique tried time and again to disrupt it. The prime minister also expressed confidence that Bangladesh will start its journey as a developing nation by 2026.
“And only the Awami League can take the country towards prosperity. Bangladesh has got the status of a developing country due to the current government’s efforts made in the last 15 years, which is now working to transform it into a developed, prosperous and Smart Bangladesh by 2041,” Hasina said.","Earlier in the year, the US and other major Western countries had called for dialogue between the ruling Awami League and the opposition to ensure an inclusive and credible election, which however, saw no headway visibly due to reluctance by both sides."
bangladesh,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-bangladesh-election-outcome-is-a-foregone-conclusion-9083929/,The Bangladesh election outcome is a foregone conclusion,"December 27, 2023, 10:32 AM",2023-12-27,27-12-2023,"From its turbulent beginning in 1971 to the military rule after the assassination of Mujibur Rahman in 1975, to caretaker governments and political alliances following the restoration of democracy in 1990, Bangladesh’s politics has been in a state of churn over the past five decades. With its 12th jatiya sansad elections coming up on January 7, there has been pressure on the country by extra-regional powers like the US, the UK, Japan, and Australia to have free, fair, transparent, participatory and meaningful elections – one that gives viable space to the opposition. The Awami League (AL), led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, has ruled Bangladesh since 2009. A cadre-based party, AL has a pan-Bangladesh presence and stands ostensibly for secular, democratic and progressive values. One of its main opposition parties is the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) alliance, which represents the right-of-centre parties/forces. It is supported by radical, orthodox political forces, like Jamaat-e-Islami (now barred from participating in the electoral process). In the forthcoming elections, the BNP has announced its decision to boycott the elections in the face of crackdowns by the government on opposition parties. One of BNP’s major demands has been free, fair and inclusive elections, that is especially relevant in the context of the government suppressing dissent by allowing arrests of members of the opposition and crippling their campaign by locking up, threatening and brutally attacking their supporters. Issues like corruption and inflation have also been linked to the protests and boycotts. Despite accusations of democratic backsliding, what the ruling AL has going for itself are its policies and performance that alone should have given it an edge in the elections. Bangladesh is expected to become a middle-income country by 2041 and is on track to graduate from the UN’s Least Developed Countries (LDC) list by 2026. As compared to other South Asian countries, Bangladesh finds itself above average on the parameters of the Human Development Index. An October World Bank report says extreme poverty has decreased from 9 per cent in 2016 to 5 per cent in 2022. The Sheikh Hasina regime has worked on a good number of infrastructure projects with major countries like India (Maitree Super Thermal Power Project in Rampal, India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline) and China (Karnaphuli tunnel, Padma Bridge rail link projects). A seven-party alliance, Ganatantra Mancha, consisting of Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD-Rab), Nagorik Oikya, Biplobi Workers Party, Gono Odhikar Parishad, Bhasani Onusari Parishad, Rastra Sangskar Andolon and Gonosanghati Andolon has posed similar questions as BNP regarding free and fair elections. BNP’s decision to abstain has also made election watchers and activists apprehensive that in its absence, hardline Islamist groups might step in to fill the void. There’s another interesting phenomenon that has emerged ahead of the elections – the rise of what is being considered to be the “king’s party” or “king’s candidates” – the formation of a party or coalition with the support or patronage of the party in power to win elections. Despite their refutation, parties like Trinamool BNP (founded by former BNP minister barrister Nazmul Huda), Bangladesh Nationalist Movement (BNM) and Bangladesh Supreme Party (BSP) are being termed as “king’s party”. Trinamool BNP is contesting 140 seats. BNP’s former ally Bangladesh Kalyan Party, and others like Bangladesh Congress and National People’s Party, are also contesting elections. The leaders of nine Islamic political parties (Bangladesh Islami Front, Bangladesh Khilafat Andolan, Islami Oikya Jote Bangladesh Muslim League, Islamic Front Bangladesh, Bangladesh Supreme Party, Aashiqeen-e- Awlia Oikya Parishad and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Bangladesh) have also met Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and decided to participate in the elections. In 2018, a similar alternative had emerged in the form of the Jukta Front or the United Front, under the initiative of Badruddoza Chowdhury. Most of the candidates had joined the Awami League after their victory. There has been speculation that these new fronts might follow a similar pattern after the election as they lack the ability to be a credible alternative to AL. In total, 1,896 candidates from 27 political parties and independent candidates are contesting for the 300 seats. The Awami League’s 14-party grand alliance is contesting in 263 seats. It has also reached a seat-sharing consensus with Jatiya Party – once its opponent – that has 26 seats allocated to it. The US has been appreciative of Bangladesh’s developmental agenda, while remaining critical about the autocratic tendencies of the ruling party. One may argue that due to the US imposing sanctions and visa restrictions on Bangladesh, it has provided the country a reason to incline towards China. In any case, to allay fears of malpractice and as a response to the extra-regional pressure, after the announcement of the elections, Bangladesh’s chief election commissioner Kazi Habibur Awal has reshuffled district administrative and police officers to ensure free, fair, transparent and participatory elections. Bangladesh’s Sena Bahini will also be deployed from December 29 for 13 days to ensure that the polls happen peacefully. In light of all of these, and considering the strength of the ruling party and the weak opposition, it can be said that the electoral outcome in Bangladesh is predictable. The winds are blowing in favour of the Awami League.

From the era when state apparatus was used to finance, protect, and promote religious extremism and militancy, the recent trend has seen a rise of violence against the people and political process by one political segment as a means of opposing the party in power. For the supporters of the democratic political process in Bangladesh, the upcoming elections are a time to stand united and prevent a rogue political force from taking control. The origins of militant Islamism Unfortunately, there is little middle ground historically in Bangladeshi politics. The seeds of militancy, extremism and Islamisation were sown even before the brutal killing of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975. This heinous crime was planned and organised, it has since been proved, with support from General Ziaur Rahman, who later became president through what can at best be called a dubious election. The attacks on the freedom fighters and secular forces started during General Zia’s time and took a political face when he formed the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). Many elements of the BNP had collaborated with Pakistan and committed crimes against humanity during the 1971 war. This became clear even to the international community and regional neighbours when his direct appointee Air Vice Marshall Muhammad Ghulam Tawab called for changing Bangladesh from a secular state to an Islamic one at a political rally. Political pundits are on the horns of a dilemma. On the one hand, there’s a party that has a long history of religious extremism, plotting political assassinations and sheltering separatists from neighbouring nations. On the other side, the ruling party which has managed to contain extremism guided the economy and made strides in terms of poverty alleviation. However, it is also blamed for becoming “the sole distributor of democracy” and not letting the Opposition carry on their “rightful democratic (if sometimes violent) protest.” Unfortunately, voters are left with little choice. The BNP has once again – for the second consecutive time – called for a boycott of the elections. The Opposition’s modus operandi is reminiscent of the underground outfits of the Cold War era. Boycott elections and implement “hit and run” tactics against law enforcement agencies and civilians, damaging a remarkable number of public and private properties. Extremists in power It is important to recall that the BNP represents a large number of Islamic parties. It sponsored the rise of the notorious militant-Islamist outfit Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) during its previous tenure in power between 2001-2006. On the evening of February 27, 2004, Professor Humayun Azad, a prominent linguist, writer and faculty member of the University of Dhaka was attacked by a killing squad of the JMB with machetes. He eventually died in Germany while recovering from the injuries. In December 2004, JMB murdered Mohammad Yunus, a professor of economics at the University of Rajshahi. In 2006, Professor Syed Taher Ahmed from the same university was murdered. Family members and the academic fraternity of the slain professor of geology pointed to the involvement of Mahbubul Alam Salehi, leader of Islami Chhatra Shibir – the much-feared armed student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh. The latter was part of the government led by the BNP. The seeds of militancy and terror attacks to establish Sharia Law in Bangladesh, sown during the BNP-led coalition government, continued to yield bitter fruit even after their downfall in 2007-2009. Sociology professor A K M Shafiul Islam was murdered on November 15, 2014, and a prominent Jubo Dal (Youth Wing of the BNP) leader was convicted for this crime. In 2015, publisher Faisal Arefin Dipan was slaughtered in his office by militant Islamists and Bangladesh-born US citizen Avijit Roy was hacked to death with a machete near the largest annual book fair in Bangladesh. In 2016, terrorists allegedly connected to the gangs bankrolled by the BNP and its allies attacked a restaurant frequented by embassy workers and foreign nationals in the upscale part of Dhaka, killing innocent civilians from Bangladesh, India, Italy and Japan and police officers. Another academician A F M Rezaul Karim Siddique was murdered in the same year. The list of attacks on liberal and secular bloggers, writers and even foreign diplomats goes on. The BNP-led government established the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) in 2004 with support from Western powers and used the outfit to unleash a spell of extra-judicial murders, targeting left-leaning political parties and Awami League activists, journalists as well as the public and to protect various Islamist-militant factions. The security apparatus was used for providing shelter, supply and camouflaging separatist activities of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) and others with the aim to destabilise the South Asian region. Why Bangladesh matters Bangladesh matters for the world, especially given the volatility in Asia. It is a global production hub and under Shiekh Hasina and the Awami League (AL), has been a bulwark against the resurgence of militancy in this geopolitically sensitive region. The AL has to deal with the spread of militancy in Bangladesh. Its prioritising economic liberalisation during the 15 years or so has yielded unprecedented results. This is recognised by the harshest critics of the government. Washington, which now claims to be “scrupulous about not picking sides” had resisted the creation of Bangladesh, assisted Pakistan in committing one of the most heinous crimes against humanity and did not recognise the Genocide of 1971 until late 2022. There is some merit to the claim that there has been a “weaponisation of the judicial system” in Bangladesh. However, many of the actions that give that argument teeth were to prevent indiscriminate attacks on civilians by extremist elements. In fact, the ground for the preemptive actions was prepared by the BNP and its allies. The indiscriminate arson attack on civilians in 2018 caused the death of over 500 Bangladeshis. The riots on Capitol Hill and the storming of Congress on January 6, 2021, resulted in the biggest police investigation in US history and nearly a thousand individuals are accused of various criminal charges. The beginning of the 21st century will be remembered as a time when democracy, liberty, freedom, and constitutional political rights of individuals are used by militant factions and extremist political parties and their leaders to wreak havoc on democratic institutions across the world. It is imperative that modern democratic societies recognise militants and extremists have adopted new counter-philosophical and moral narratives to attack the very foundation of democracy. For Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and the citizens of Bangladesh, the threat of being imprisoned by militancy is an everyday reality.

The attack coincided with the nationwide stoppage called by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) on Tuesday as part of its ongoing campaign to boycott the polls and launch a formal protest against the Election Commission’s polls schedule. The arson attack on the train was the fifth in the past month but the deadliest so far in terms of casualties. The miscreants set on fire three compartments of the Dhaka-bound inter-district Mohanganj Express early morning shortly after the train left the Airport Railway Station at the entry point of the capital, police and witnesses said. “The passengers saw the fire after the train left the Airport station, it was stopped at the next stop at Tejgaon station,” Tejgaon police station officer-in-charge Mohammad Mohsin said. At least four persons, including a woman and her child, have died after the train was set on fire amid a hartal called by the BNP. Mohsin said another minor boy was missing while his mother awaited in front of the gutted compartment as fire service rescuers were searching inside. Railway officials said the locomotive master halted the train at Tejgaon where the fire service rescuers doused the blaze and retrieved four bodies while two of the dead remained unidentified. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s ruling Awami League has emerged as the prime contender in the absence of ailing ex-premier Khaleda Zia’s BNP which has boycotted the January 7 polls since its demands for a no-party caretaker government to organise the voting were not met. Awami League is contesting the polls against its technical Opposition in Parliament Jatiya Party and independent candidates, including the rebel contenders who fielded their candidature after failing to secure the party nomination. Awami League earlier said it would encourage the independent, including the party’s rebel candidates to make the polls participatory though voters have little option other than reelecting the ruling party for the fourth consecutive term since the December 2008 elections. One passenger was killed last week and dozens wounded as saboteurs uprooted railway tracks on the same train on the same route last week when seven carriages derailed in Gazipur on the outskirts of the capital. Dozens of trucks, buses and private cars were torched since late October while the violence killed at least six persons.
Hasina, meanwhile, said, “They can’t oust the government by killing people”. Bangladesh will deploy the Army for 13 days from December 29 to maintain order “in aid of civil power” ahead of the January 7 general elections amid the political unrest. However, the military called it a routine poll time duty. The Election Commission announced the polls schedule on November 15 amid continued political unrest. BNP has repeatedly been saying no election under the ruling Awami League would be fair, demanding the government’s resignation to pave the way for an interim non-party neutral government for polls oversight. Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal earlier said despite the need for a “congenial atmosphere” for a smooth election, “for a long time there exist differences of opinions among political leaderships on the question of election, particularly over the institutional method of the polling”. In a veiled reference to BNP and its allies, Awal said his office invited all registered political parties who were “reluctant” to take part in the upcoming polls for dialogues with the Commission but “they rejected the invitation”. But he asked the nearly 110 million voters to freely exercise their rights franchise in an “enthusiastic atmosphere, discarding all worries, tensions and unease”. BNP had boycotted the 2014 election but took part in 2018 polls, which party leaders later said was a mistake alleging that the voting was marred with widespread rigging and intimidation. According to media reports, over 10,000 opposition leaders and activists, including BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir have been arrested in a nationwide crackdown while BNP claimed the figure to be as high as 20,000. A Dhaka court on Monday denied a bail request from Alamgir, meaning he could not guide his party ahead of the election next month. He is the key party leader since the ailing Zia is hospitalised and faces 17 years of imprisonment following her conviction in two corruption cases that her party says were politically motivated.",The attack coincided with the nationwide stoppage called by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) on Tuesday as part of its ongoing campaign to boycott the polls and launch a formal protest against the Election Commission's polls schedule.
bangladesh,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/a-decade-and-4-deadlines-later-india-set-to-eliminate-kala-azar-this-yr-9061702/,"A decade and 4 deadlines later, India set to eliminate kala azar this year","December 13, 2023, 06:29 PM",2023-12-13,13-12-2023,"After missing the deadline thrice, India is poised to achieve the elimination target for visceral leishmaniasis or kala azar this year with no block in the country reporting more than one case per 10,000 people. In October, Bangladesh became the first country in the world to be officially validated by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for eliminating kala azar as a public health problem. India now needs to sustain its momentum over the next three years in order to receive the WHO certification. “With the elimination target just a year away, the team started working rigorously after the pandemic. And, we started to see the results. We haven’t seen more than one case per 10,000 population in any of the blocks since January this year,” said Rajiv Manjhi, the Joint Secretary overseeing kala azar and other vector-borne infection programmes. Kala azar is a parasitic infection transmitted by sandflies. It causes fever, weight loss, and spleen and liver enlargement. Left untreated, it can be fatal in 95% of cases. India recorded 530 cases and four deaths due to the infection till October this year, compared to 891 cases and three deaths in 2022. There were 1,357 cases and eight deaths recorded in 2021. There were also 286 reported cases of post-kala azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) till October 2023. Completely curing the skin condition is essential as it can act as a reservoir for the parasite. In December last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a ‘Mann ki Baat’ radio broadcast that India was on the brink of eliminating kala azar after diseases such as smallpox, polio and guinea worm. From more than 50 districts across four states, the disease was found to be higher than elimination levels in just four districts in Bihar and Jharkhand. “I am sure the strength and awareness of the people of Bihar and Jharkhand will help the government’s efforts to eliminate kala azar from these four districts as well,” he had said. India’s first target year for kala azar elimination was 2010. This was later pushed to 2015, 2017 and 2020. There were three key interventions that helped India achieve the elimination targets this year, Manjhi said. The first was ensuring effective indoor residual spraying. The sandflies that transmit the infection usually breed in the crevices of mud walls. Effective spraying can prevent breeding and reduce the spread of the disease. “Initially, when central teams checked houses, where indoor residual spraying had already been done, we still kept finding sandflies. This meant there was some deficiency in the mixing of chemicals or spraying. With Central teams as well as senior district officials monitoring the process, effective spraying was ensured,” he said. The second was reducing crevices in ‘kuccha’ walls to reduce breeding areas. “We started using Gerrard soil that is found in Jharkhand and neighbouring areas to plaster the walls and crevices. The soil does not come off easily and ensures that breeding doesn’t happen,” he said. Under the third intervention, the ASHA (About Accredited Social Health Activist) network was tasked with ensuring that people with PKDL complete their treatment. While one intravenous dose of the antimicrobial drug amphotericin B is effective in curing kala azar, those with PKDL need to take the medicine Miltefosine for 12 weeks. Dr Kavita Singh, South Asia Director at the not-for-profit research organisation Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi), explained that compliance is poor because the treatment is long and many a times the patients are asymptomatic. She added that Miltefosine is also teratogenic — meaning it results in abnormal development of the foetus during pregnancy. The drug cannot be given to children and pregnant women. In fact, women shouldn’t conceive while on the treatment and for three months after, she said. One of the key challenges now would be to ensure strong surveillance to pick up even the few cases that come up. In addition, said Manjhi, there would be a need to monitor new areas. “While most of the kala azar cases in the country were reported from four states — Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal — sporadic cases from other states are also reported. We have to monitor states such as Uttarakhand that have a potential to become hotspots,” he said. Dr Singh said there was also a need to ensure availability of drugs such as paromomycin, used to treat those with HIV and kala azar. Kala azar has a tendency to relapse in HIV patients, she said, adding that second-line treatment, such as paromomycin along with amphotericin, is important. Dr Singh said: “Although it is mentioned in the programme, the medicine is not really available in India. It can be procured from the WHO. But the effort needs to be made.”","Kala azar is a parasitic infection transmitted by sandflies. It causes fever, weight loss, and spleen and liver enlargement.

bangladesh,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/bangladesh-india-partition-land-plots-survey-9056723/,Partition’s shadow: Tripura to take stock of plots ‘exchanged’ between refugees fleeing either side,"December 06, 2023, 02:41 PM",2023-12-06,6-12-2023,"The Bangladesh Liberation War may have ended in 1971, but 52 years later, it continues to cast its shadow on the lives of ordinary people across the subcontinent, especially in the states bordering the erstwhile East Pakistan. In Tripura, the state government has started an in-depth survey to record the status of land plots exchanged between people from here who moved to erstwhile East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and people from those parts who moved to India. After Islamabad launched Operation Searchlight in East Pakistan in 1971 to crack down on the movement for Bangladesh liberation, lakhs of East Pakistanis, many of whom had already been seeking shelter in India, moved en masse to Tripura and West Bengal. With a population of 16 lakh at the time, Tripura sheltered an estimated 15 lakh East Pakistani refugees, with 35-40 refugee camps set up in different parts of the state. The state also hosted five major, fully-functional Mukti Joddha (irregular Bangladeshi liberation army) training camps, set up with the BSF and Indian Army support, putting Tripura right in the middle of a full-blown war. While most of the people went back after the War, many chose to stay on. Most of them were Hindus, who exchanged land plots with Muslims in the state, who migrated to what became Bangladesh. While successive governments have conducted a series of surveys between 1980 and 2006 in different phases to find out the status of these land plots, a new survey, verification and validation process has just been initiated. An official of the revenue department, who didn’t wish to be named, said the process was launched as per guidelines of the Ministries of External Affairs and Home, and that District Magistrates are now conducting field inquiries to find out if occupants of these plots have got valid documents or not. “We have identified 2,117 cases of people who migrated to Bangladesh leaving land here. Some people migrated from East Pakistan here and exchanged plots, some occupied plots with unregistered deeds, some without even these. There might also be people who didn’t migrate but occupied such plots. This survey and verification process will find out the exact status of these plots,” the official said. As per preliminary findings, Sepahijala district, which borders Bangladesh, has one of the highest numbers of exchanged plots. According to government regulations, the land plots occupied without valid documents would be termed property of the State. “Those having valid documents like exchange deeds or registered deeds would be assisted in getting their land mutated. Anyone occupying land without documentation would be asked to take it on lease,” the official said. The government has assured that no one would be evicted from the exchanged land, and some sort of policy decision on exchanged properties would be taken later. Many people who migrated from erstwhile East Pakistan and settled in Tripura claim they were landlords in their erstwhile country and had escaped with just their life in the middle of hostilities. Governments have conducted similar exercises earlier in West Bengal, Assam and other states. However, among these, Tripura bore the most impact of migration. It transformed the state’s demography, and the tribals who were once a majority in Tripura are now just 30% of the population.","2,117 cases identified of plots left behind by people who migrated to either side; govt says bid to regularise records, no one will be evicted"
bangladesh,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/now-low-fare-flights-from-n-e-to-bangladesh-thailand-and-myanmar-9051881/,"Now, low-fare flights from N-E to Bangladesh, Thailand and Myanmar","December 03, 2023, 05:59 AM",2023-12-03,3-12-2023,"IN A first, four new air routes connecting northeastern states with international destinations have been approved under the Centre’s flagship regional air connectivity scheme UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik). These will connect Assam to Thailand and Bangladesh, Manipur to Myanmar and Tripura to Bangladesh. To be operational in a few weeks, airfares on these approved routes — Guwahati-Bangkok, Guwahati-Dhaka, Imphal-Mandalay and Agartala-Chittagong — under the UDAN scheme, will be subsidised. “These new routes have been in the pipeline since the concerned states made a demand,” Anil Kumar Gupta, Executive Director, Airports Authority of India (AAI) told The Indian Express, on the sidelines of the recently-held 11th International Tourism Mart in Shillong. Reasonable airfares could boost tourism from neighbouring countries like Bangladesh, Myanmar and Bhutan in the northeastern states, said officials in the Ministry of Tourism, which organises such a meeting every year in one of the eight northeastern states highlighting their tourism potential and rich biodiversity. Four more routes connecting the northeast to neighbouring countries are further under consideration, Gupta said. International routes have to be cleared by the ministries of Home Affairs and External Affairs too. Under the UDAN scheme, concerned states subsidise the airfares. The Airports Authority of India runs the bid process, selects the airlines, and informs the states about operators interested to offer services on the said routes. States then pick the subsidy tab by providing viability gap funding to the lowest bidder. In the last seven years, states offering regional air connectivity under the UDAN scheme have spent Rs 3,000 crore on subsidies. The four new routes being considered promise huge tourism and business travel potential between the two cities. Of these, Guwahati-Dhaka and Agartala-Chittagong are under 500 km and once operational, may cost travellers under Rs 4,000. With fares under Rs 4,000, states in the northeast with rich culture and biodiversity can attract a large number of tourists from neighbouring countries. Expanding air connectivity will also promote socio-economic growth. Under the UDAN scheme launched in 2017, airlines could charge up to Rs 2,500 for journeys under 500 km for 40 seats on a flight (not for all seats). Now, they can charge up to Rs 3,800, say officials. The ‘International UDAN’, conceived and launched in 2022, aimed to promote socio-economic growth by enhancing air connectivity from certain states to select international destinations. Most of these routes requested by the northeastern states are untested and haven’t had an international flight so far. Presently, there are two international airports in the northeastern region – at Guwahati and Imphal, and are operated by Guwahati International Airport Limited (GIAL) and AAI, respectively. A new terminal building at Agartala Airport has been designed as an integrated terminal keeping in view the future requirement for international operations, according to a statement by VK Singh, Minister of State, Civil Aviation, in Parliament, in April 2022. The AAI is also upgrading the Imphal Airport — already declared an international airport — to handle 2.4 million passengers a year.","To be operational in a few weeks, airfares on these approved routes — Guwahati-Bangkok, Guwahati-Dhaka, Imphal-Mandalay and Agartala-Chittagong — under the UDAN scheme, will be subsidised."
