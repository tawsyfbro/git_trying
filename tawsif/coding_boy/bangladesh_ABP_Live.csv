Bangladesh has been witnessing a sudden spike in anti-India campaign there which is apparently been driven by the opposition party there, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and it’s primary ally Jamaat-e-Islami party. The anti-India sloganeering in Bangladesh has taken similar tone like in Maldives as they are also calling for an ‘India-Out’ campaign. “The anti-India sentiments there are diminishing… Anti-Indian elements are there in Bangladesh and those who spread that issue they try to utilise anti-India sentiments time to time but it is diminishing,” said Mahmud, a senior leader of the ruling Awami League party, addressing reporters at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of South Asia. He said there are number of protests happening in Bangladesh almost every day as it is a “free society” and people have the right to protest. He said many such protests take place “anti-US, anti-China, anti-India.” The Foreign Minister said the important aspect about the bilateral ties is growing trade between India and Bangladesh. He highlighted that it was due to India that Prime Minister Hasina could come back to power and it was “India’s assistance” that helped Bangladesh in “continuation of democracy” there. “India was beside us for continuation of democracy,” he said, adding that the BNP-Jamaat coalition did not leave any stone unturned to disrupt the democratic process of holding elections there. He also spoke about the violence unleashed by BNP-Jamaat, including attacking the residence ofChief Justice Obaidul Hassan, which was unprecedented. Mahmud added, “The current opposition party BNP and Jamaat has been trying to disrupt the democratic process. Despite all the hurdles democracy is thriving and inequality is reducing.” The minister said during his two-day visit to New Delhi he discussed the Rohingya refugee issue with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar as well as National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. He said India and Bangladesh should “work together” in this matter and addressing the rising security challenges emanating from Myanmar. He also said that like India Bangladesh is also facing issues of Myanmar security forces entering Bangladesh and taking refuge there. “We had 340 Myanmar border guards and soldiers entering Bangladesh. On this issue we should work together (with India). We are in discussion with Myanmar also and they are willing to take them back,” he added. He said during the visit India and Myanmar also discussed the issue of We discussed the issue of killings of Bangladesh border guards. “We are working on that,” he stressed.

However, he was unable to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which was on his itinerary. On Friday, Mahmud will be going to Kolkata from where he will be leaving for Dhaka.

The two-day visit began Tuesday during which time Mahmud met External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. Mahmud, a senior leader of the ruling Awami League party of Bangladesh, arrived in New Delhi on Tuesday. This was his first official bilateral visit since assuming charge. On Wednesday the External Affairs Minister held delegation-level talks with him and also hosted a dinner in his honour. In both his meetings with Jaishankar as well as Doval, he raised the issue of Rohingya refugees and how that has the potential to become a greater threat for both the countries. “The situation in Myanmar is a worrying factor for both countries because we share a border with Myanmar. We discussed the issue with the NSA because for regional peace and stability, it is important that peace prevails in Myanmar,” said Mahmud addressing reporters. He also said, “We have given them shelter. We are in consultations with Myanmar and requesting them to take them back. Our ambassador in Myanmar has met with the foreign minister of Myanmar and they have agreed to take them back. How they will take them back – through a ship or by air – that is a question of discussion.” This is not the first time that Bangladesh has raised the matter with India. In fact, Mahmud’s predecessor AK Abdul Momen had been discussing this issue with India for the past five years even as the number of Rohingya refugees coming into that country has been swelling ever since the Myanmar military coup took place in February 2021. Dhaka has repeatedly asked New Delhi to speak to the government of Myanmar on behalf of them to settle the matter. Currently, a whopping 1.2 million Rohingya refugees are living in Bangladesh’s Cox Bazar area. After his meeting with NSA Doval, Mahmud said on X, ""I had excellent meeting with national security advisor of India Mr. Ajit Doval. We discussed numberof security issues including Rohingya issue. It was really an excellent meeting."" Earlier this month Doval undertook a quiet visit to Bangladesh as India is facing greater security threats in the northeast region which is also witnessing massive influx of Myanmar citizens as well as security forces in states like Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland. Bangladesh has now decided that it will not accept anymore Rohingya refugees in the country. There have been growing incidents of violence and clashes along the Bangladesh-Myanmar border. This has led to Myanmar forces and border guards taking shelter in Bangladesh. On Tuesday, Bangladesh lodged a strong protest over the death of Bangladeshi nationals from mortar shells and bullets fired from Myanmar side in the border areas. According to Mahmud, he will continue with the same agenda as his predecessor did. Mahmud was appointed as the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina came back to power for the fifth time by winning a landslide victory in January this year. According to the Ministry of External Affairs, both Mahmud and Jaishankar, “reviewed the progress in wide-ranging areas of bilateral relations, including cross-border connectivity, economic and development partnership, cooperation in defence and security, power, energy, water resources and people-to-people exchanges.” The MEA also said, both the ministers discussed areas of future engagement in line with the national development goals of the two countries, including the visions of ‘Viksit Bharat 2047’ and ‘Smart Bangladesh 2041’. “The visit of Foreign Minister of Bangladesh to India is part of the on-going high-level exchanges between the two countries and has enabled both sides to chart out the course of their forward-looking engagement during the new term of the Government in Bangladesh,” said the MEA.",During his first visit to India as the new Foreign Minister of Bangladesh Hasan Mahmud said the Rohingya issue has become a security challenge for the country.
India,Mohammad Salman,https://news.abplive.com/fact-check/hindu-family-murder-in-bangladesh-sparks-false-communal-claim-of-hindu-muslim-1662550,Fact Check: Hindu Family's Murder In Bangladesh Sparks False Communal Narrative,"February 07, 2024, 03:05 PM",2024-02-07,7-2-2024,"What is the claim? Images and claims concerning the murder of a Hindu family in Bangladesh have been circulating on social media, attributing the act to communal violence. These claims, accompanied by distressing images of the victims, have sparked widespread attention and concern.(Note: Due to the sensitive nature of these visuals, we have chosen not to include links to the original posts or archived versions.) A post on X (formerly known as Twitter) claimed, ""In Bangladesh, three members of the same Hindu family were murdered by Islamists by beheading them at home."" This post received significant engagement, with over 16,000 views. Another user shared images with a caption alleging that Islamists killed a Hindu leader's family in Sirajganj. The victims were identified as Bikash Sarkar, Swarna Sarkar, and their daughter, Parmita Sarkar Tushi. However, we found that the claim is false. The accused, as well as the victims, are from the same family – identified as Vikas Sarkar, his wife Swarna Rani Sarkar, and their 15-year-old daughter. How did we verify this? In our investigation, we discovered comments from Shonahur Rehman, a fact-checker based in Bangladesh, on a viral post. He clarified that the incident lacked a communal angle, identifying the accused as the deceased man's nephew, Rajiv Kumar Bhoumik. A search in English and Bangla led us to various news reports concerning the incident. The Daily Star, on January 31, 2024, reported the arrest of Rajiv Kumar Bhoumik for the murder of three family members in Sirajganj's Tarasha. The article cited Sirajganj Police Superintendent Arifur Rehman, who stated that Rajiv confessed to committing the murders due to his inability to repay a loan of 35 lakh Bangladeshi Taka owed to his maternal uncle. The victims were identified as Vikas Sarkar (46), his wife Swarna Rani Sarkar (42), and their 15-year-old daughter. A murder case was filed by Sukomol Chandra Saha, Swarna Rani Sarkar's brother, at the Tarash police station. The murder received extensive coverage in major Bangladeshi media outlets, including the Daily Star English, Financial Express, and Daily Observer, all of which reported Rajiv Bhoumik as the accused. A local fact-checker shared some of these reports with us. A press conference conducted by Arifur Rahman, the Superintendent of Police, was posted on the YouTube channel of Channel i News on January 31, 2024. In the video, the Superintendent also named the deceased’s nephew as the accused. The verdict Our investigation conclusively demonstrates that the claim of Muslims brutally murdering a Hindu family in Bangladesh is false. The accused is the deceased man's nephew, with the police citing the inability to repay his uncle's debt as the motive. This incident does not have a communal aspect. (Translated by Azra Ali.)

In the report he submitted to the All India Football Federation (AIFF), Stimac said the national team's performance in the Asian Cup in Doha, where it suffered three losses, was ""disappointing but not unexpected"". ""I'm truly realistic person ...and for now we should be happy and satisfied when continuously participating at the AFC Asian Cup. The reason for saying that is very simple and logical,"" Stimac wrote in his report. ""...how to expect our NT (national team) to do well while our best ISL teams are losing heavily in AFC Champion League and suffering defeats in AFC Cup club competitions against teams from Bangladesh and Maldives?"" Stimac was spot on in his comments as Indian clubs rarely make it to the knock-out rounds of the continental level tournaments. He also said that India was the only country among the 24 participants in the Asian Cup without a single player playing in a major football league in the world. ""How we can expect more from our boys if we had never in our history qualified for the Asian Cup in U18/U20/U23? If we are so much behind others in under age groups than qualifying with senior NT is already huge achievement,"" the experienced Croatian coach said. Stimac was also critical of the AIFF administration for not providing the available tools to strengthen the national team as other countries do. ""Apart from Australia, South Korea and Japan (most of their players are playing in best European leagues), all other participating teams had average time of 27 days for preparation for the AFC Asian Cup. We had only 13 days,"" Stimac rued. ""We were the only team at the tournament without GPS equipment which made our job really difficult. Apart from that it affects the players when they see that basic training equipment is missing and we can't measure training effectiveness or neither prevent certain injuries."" He reiterated that the team was also weakened by the absence of Ashique Kuruniyan, Jeakson Singh and Anwar Ali. Another key player, Sahal Abdul Samad, was available only for the last game against Syria. ""(They) were giving our team stability in all aspects of the game (physical, technical, tactical and mental). Not having them fully fit for such important tournament was irreplaceable loss. ""Most of Bengaluru and Mohun Bagan players joined us after having terrible spell with their respective clubs prior to the AFC Asian Cup. Thinking of replacing so many of them for the Asian Cup with other ISL players was never an option."" After a gritty 0-2 defeat against Australia in the opening match, Stimac was hoping for a good show against Uzbekistan, but he was left disappointed with a 0-3 loss. ""Our best game was against Australia, which wasn't (a) surprise because we prepared twice as long for that game as for the other two. ""The match against Uzbekistan was a big disappointment personally because I was expecting that good performance against Australia would boost our confidence and have more concrete effect on boys. ""Instead of raising up in our game we became vulnerable and let in cheap goals in a similar way to Qatar game. We knew that Uzbekistan is technically excellent team that mercilessly punishes mistakes. ""We did face the problem few days prior to this game with Sandesh Jinghan suffering from fever and not feeling (well) which obviously had impact on his game."" He said after the team conceded three first-half goals, he had to ""choose the right words during the break in the locker room to avoid a real result disaster"".

Hussain took charge of the scoring but eventually fell victim to a well-disguised delivery from Rohanat Doullah Borson, which sharply jagged in and uprooted his off stump.

In the second innings, Ubaid Shah mounted a comeback for Pakistan by claiming two quick wickets upfront. Maintaining the momentum, Ubaid, supported by Ali Raza and Mohammad Zeeshan, consistently took wickets, restricting Bangladesh to 127 for 9 wickets. As the situation looked challenging for Bangladesh, Rohanat Doullah Borson provided a glimmer of hope with a crucial six off Arafat Minhas.

The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) accused the 83-year-old economist and 13 others of misappropriating approximately Tk 25.22 crore (USD 2.29 million) from Grameen Telecom Workers' Profit Participation Fund, according to PTI. Yunus, the chairman of Grameen Telecom, which he established as a non-profit organisation, is among the defendants, including its directors, managing director, and employees' trade union leaders. An ACC spokesman informed reporters that they had filed the charge sheet against Yunus and 13 others at the Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court of Dhaka. The court scheduled March 3 for an indictment hearing in the case. Law Minister Anisul Huq refuted claims of harassing Yunus, stating the government did not fabricate any false cases against him. ""Dr Yunus was warned and advised to prevent these violations, but he ignored them. So, the Labour Department filed a lawsuit,"" Huq explained. ""No one is above the law, and if someone commits a crime, they must face the law,"" he added, according to PTI. Earlier, ACC Secretary Mahmub Hossain mentioned that the proceedings against Yunus stemmed from complaints by the Department of Inspection for Factories and Establishments. The statutory graft agency filed the charge sheet after extensive investigation. Yunus, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his anti-poverty efforts, is confronted with over 150 other cases, including major corruption charges that could result in imprisonment if proven guilty. The economist denies all allegations. Last week, an appeals court granted bail to Yunus, who received a six-month prison sentence on January 1 for violating the country's labour laws. The court also agreed to hear an appeal against his sentence. The recent development follows concerns expressed by over 241 global leaders, including 125 Nobel laureates, regarding the ""continuous judicial harassment and potential jailing"" of Yunus in a third open letter to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Irene Khan, the UN Special Rapporteur for the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression, denounced the January 1 verdict as ""a travesty of justice"". Khan emphasized that the social activist, ""who brought honour and pride to the country, is being persecuted on frivolous grounds."" The letter, signed by global leaders, including former US President Barack Obama, echoed Khan's sentiment, criticizing the rushed legal process and inconsistent application of Bangladesh's laws. Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also reacted to the verdict, stating, ""Bangladeshis deserve a government that honours and supports -- rather than persecutes -- its most esteemed citizens"". Hasina's Awami League party secured a record fourth consecutive term in the general election held on January 7. International rights groups, including Amnesty International, condemned the verdict, while several prominent Bangladeshi civil society figures decried Yunus's exposure to legal ""harassment"". Responding to the previous global leaders' letter, Hasina proposed that experts, including lawyers, examine all documents related to Yunus and his cases to determine any wrongdoing or wrongful prosecution. The global leaders accepted her proposal in their third letter, published as a full-page advertisement in the Washington Post. The economist has been in a prolonged dispute with the incumbent government since 2008.

However, during his innings, he was involved in a heated exchange with the Dhaka side wicketkeeper Irfan Sukkur.In the viral clip which has surfaced on social media, Dhaka player Mohammad Naim Sheikh can be seen trying to calm down Irfan while Babar says to the keeper: ""I am not talking to you.”Take a look at the viral video here: Wicket Keeper: Babar ye T20 hai, test match nahi Babar Azam: I’m not talking to you, I’m not talking to you 😭 pic.twitter.com/BrIgtTViCr  Rangpur Riders Beat Durdanto Dhaka By 79 RunsWhile Riders set Dhaka a target of 184 runs to win, Dhaka's pursuit of that total was jolted by Mahedi Hasan's 3/11.

Wazed, presently the chairperson of Bangladesh's National Advisory Committee on Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders, is set to assume office on February 1, 2024, for a five-year term, with the possibility of reappointment. The election process had political implications, given Wazed's familial connection to the Bangladeshi Prime Minister. The contest became a test for India's 'Neighbourhood First' policy, and diplomatic sources told ABP LIVE that Nepal had concerns about receiving favourable support from India due to the close relationship between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Sheikh Hasina. Diplomatic channels were reportedly engaged by Nepal in an effort to secure votes for Acharya. However, Wazed received backing not only from India but also from the United States. Washington acknowledged Wazed's contributions to revamping public health regulations in Bangladesh. As the WHO Regional Director for South-East Asia, Wazed will play a pivotal role in shaping public health responses in a region that houses a quarter of the global population and bears 30 per cent of the global disease burden.

New Delhi has already extended a formal invitation to Mahmud for an early visit to India. The new Bangladeshiforeignminister will be also attending the annual Raisina Dialogue, organised bytheORFin collaboration with the Ministry of External Affairs, from February 21-23. India’s High Commissioner to Bangladesh Pranay Verma was the first envoy of any country to meet Mahmud after he was named the newforeignminister in a surprise rejig of the older cabinet underPMHasina. On Monday, addressing a press conference in Dhaka, Mahmud saidIndia has always stood by India in establishing a democratic government in that country. “Conspiracies existed to tamper with the 2014 elections. In 2018, there were efforts to make the elections controversial and questionable. However, India was on our side…You all know India's position in the elections this year too,” he said, adding that he is planning to visit India soon, without mentioning the dates. During his visit to India,sources said, Mahmudis expected to give “fresh push” to the Teestariver water sharing pact, whichhasweigh downthebilateral ties for many decades. While the two countries were able to sign the Land Boundary Agreement in 2015, the Teesta water dispute remains static,thesources said. Teesta is the fourth largest transboundary river between the two countries. It is a tributary of the Brahmaputra, which flows through Sikkim and West Bengal before entering Bangladesh. Under an agreement finalised in 2011 between both the sides, India would get 42.5 per cent and Bangladesh around 37.5 per cent of the water during the dry season. However, the treaty continues to remain in limbo due to stiff opposition from the West Bengal government under Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Water is a state subject in India.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning reacting to a question from the official media about Awami League’s “landslide victory,” spoke about Beijing’s relations with Dhaka, especially its infrastructure projects, but any reference to Prime Minister Hasina was conspicuously absent from Mao’s remarks on Bangladesh polls. Hasina’s Awami League won a landslide victory in Sunday’s Parliamentary elections that were boycotted by the Bangladesh National Party (BNP), the major opposition party. “China congratulates Bangladesh on holding a smooth general election as scheduled and we congratulate the Awami League on winning the election,” Mao Ning said. “As a friend and neighbour, China firmly supports Bangladesh in advancing its post-election political agenda in accordance with the law”, she said. “China stands ready to work with the new Bangladesh government on the basis of mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit and non-interference in each other’s internal affairs to carry forward our traditional friendship, deepen high-quality BRI cooperation and strive for new progress in China-Bangladesh strategic partnership of cooperation,” Mao said. Bangladesh is one of the largest recipients of Chinese investments. During President Xi Jinping's visit to Dhaka in 2016, China committed to providing USD 40 billion for various investment projects under which Bangladesh will receive USD 26 billion for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects and USD 14 billion for joint venture projects. BRI is an ambitious programme for raising China-funded infrastructure across multiple countries aimed at boosting China's economic and diplomatic clout. The rapid expansion of Chinese investments in Bangladesh was regarded as the second highest by Beijing after the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Observers say Prime Minister Hasina, who has been in power since 2009, maintained close ties with India and China and made effective use of investments from both countries to develop road and industrial infrastructure in the country.

The victory is expected to further enhance bilateral ties between Dhaka and New Delhi pushing Bangladesh to expedite conclusion of the free trade deal, or Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), and also implement connectivity plans. No sooner did Hasina come back to power, with the ruling Awami Leaguewinning223 seats inthe300-seat Parliament, strategic play between Dhaka’s two big neighbours, India and China, began withtheenvoys of both India and China calling on her to discuss the roadmap ahead. India’s High Commissioner to Bangladesh Pranay Verma was the first one to call onPMHasina, followed by Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen.

According to another source, Bangladesh will now put greater focus on stabilising the growth their economy has been witnessing and for that it would partner more with its immediate powerful neighbour like India. ALSO READ | 'Those With Ties To Terrorist Orgs...': Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina On Oppn Boycott After Poll Win TheIndia-Bangladesh CEPA was announced in September 2022 when Hasina was on a visit to India. However, the official round of negotiations are yet to start while a joint working group on trade has been set up. The JWG met in October 2023 to lay down a roadmap on launching the talks and concluding it. Under the CEPA, both countries will reduce and eliminate tariffs on a range of good traded between them. The CEPA will also seek to ease movement of professionals, services and investment. Riva Ganguly Das, former Indian High Commissioner to Dhaka, said: “PM Hasina has set the tone for the future of bilateral ties with India the day of the election. The ties are expected to move forward on all fronts with India. Bangladesh has bipartisan support on our side. There has been forward movement in all aspects, especially in connectivity, be it inland waterways, ports and railway links.” Sheadded:“We need to conclude the CEPA now for a greater economic integration of the whole region. Then there is BBIN too, which is a negotiated draft. Under PM Modi, there has been a lot of improvement in the ties.” The BBIN (Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal) Motor Vehicle Agreement was signed in June 2015. It sought to bring in a plan of mutual cross border movement of passenger and goods for overall economic development of the region. On election day,just before casting her vote, Hasina, 76, said: “We are very lucky. India is our trusted friend. During our Liberation War, they supported us. After 1975, when we lost our whole family, they gave us shelter. Our best wishes to the people of India.” However, issues such as the Teesta Water Sharing pact, border management and Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) can act as continuous irritants in the bilateral ties. Abdul Mannan, Professor and Former Chairman, University Grants Commission of Bangladesh, told ABP LIVE from Dhaka: “There are few burning points that will always be an issue standing between the relationship between the two countries. Teesta Water sharing issue, border killing and cumbersome visa issuing policy by India has always been a bone of contention and puts the Awami League government in a delicate position.” Mannan, who is presently Professor of Business at the Bangladesh’s University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh, said: “Currently 500,00 Indians work in Bangladesh which has been officially acknowledged. The visa policy has to be made simpler immediately and the Teesta Water Sharing problem resolved immediately, if possible before the next Indian election. Bangladesh-India relationship has to be based on a win-win situation.” Meanwhile, the Chinese have said in a statement after their envoy Yao met PM Hasina that they are “committed to working with her to carry forward the long-established friendship, enhance mutual trust, and deepen practical cooperation – thereby uplift the China-Bangladesh Strategic Partnership of Cooperation to a new height"". Bangladesh is part of China’s flagship project, Belt and Road Initiative or the BRI, under which both sides have signed on to a ‘Vision 2041’ wherein Beijing will assist Dhaka to develop the country over a 20-year period. In 2016,China promised to invest around $26 billion for BRI projects and $14 billion on joint ventures, which includes the Padma Bridge, the country’s longest.

In a move that paved the way for Hasina’s landslide victory in the January 6 elections is the boycotting of polls by the BNP. They decided to boycott the polls as PM Hasina refused to step down and give way to a caretaker government. The BNP have also resorted to India bashing for several years even as Hasina has consistently maintained friendly ties with New Delhi. Hasina and Zia are considered to be arch rivals,and the rivalrywill continue to create political disturbance in that country. The BNP Monday said they have rejected the election and blamed the ruling party for “vote robbery and vote rigging”.At a press conference in Dhaka, BNP Standing Committee member Abdul Moyeen Khan said: “A free and fair election is necessary for what didn’t happen yesterday (Sunday). So, people have turned down this election.” Foreign observers,which included higher officials from the United States, Australia and Norway,have said Sunday’s elections were held in a “free, fair and safe manner”. “There was some violence during the election. If you see the history of Bangladesh, unfortunately election time violence has become the norm. BNP by not participating in the election has really lost out,” said Das. According to Mannan, PM Hasina will now have to build a credible cabinet, which she failed to do during her last tenure. “She (Hasina) needs to build a capable team, put the right people in the right place which was absent in her previous rule. She also needs to reorganize her party to some extentand appoint some capable advisors outside the cabinet. The taming of runaway inflation is a big challenge and so is the collection of internal revenue. As for BNP it may be in a very bad shape,” he said.

The 76-year-old leader, who has been ruling the strategically located South Asian nation since 2009, secured a record fourth consecutive term and fifth overall term in the one-sided election, which witnessed a low turnout. Awami League General Secretary Obaidul Quader claimed that the people have rejected the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami’s boycott of the election by casting their ballots. ""I sincerely thank those who braved the fear of vandalism, arson, and terrorism to participate in the 12th national parliamentary elections,” Quader said. Jatiya Party Chairman GM Quader won the Rangpur-3 seat in the 12th national parliamentary election. According to the initial estimates, the voter turnout was around 40 per cent but the figure could change after the final count, Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal earlier said. The 2018 general election recorded an overall turnout of more than 80 per cent. Despite the largely peaceful voting, officials and the mainstream media reported at least 18 arson attacks across the country since late Friday, with 10 of them targeting polling places. Former premier Khaleda Zia-led Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) leaders said the party plans to intensify its anti-government movement through a peaceful public engagement programme from Tuesday as it dubbed the polls as ""fake."" The BNP boycotted the 2014 election but joined the one in 2018. This time, they boycotted the polls. Fifteen other political parties also boycotted the election. The party leaders claimed that the low turnout was evidence that their boycott movement had been successful. They said that peaceful democratic protest programmes will be accelerated, and the people's right to vote will be established through this programme. The BNP is observing a 48-hour nationwide general strike which began at 6 am on Saturday and will end at 6 am on Monday. It had called upon voters to shun the election to mark the beginning of an end of what it calls a ""fascist government."" Earlier, an election commission spokesman said that other than some sporadic incidents of violence, the voting was largely peaceful in 299 of the 300 constituencies. The Commission suspended polling in one seat because of the death of a candidate. The election commission cancelled the candidature of a ruling Awami League candidate in northeastern Chattogram at the fag-end of the voting hours as he “scolded and threatened” a police officer. The usual election-day fervour was nowhere to be seen. Even in front of the election campaign booths, there was no presence of voters except the ruling party-backed supporters and election agents. Voters cast their votes without any disruption in the absence of long queues, leaving presiding officers with idle time. Prime Minister Hasina cast her vote at Dhaka City College polling centre soon after the voting started. Her daughter Saima Wazed accompanied her. She alleged that the opposition BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami alliance does not believe in democracy. ""People will vote as they wish. And we were able to create that voting environment. Although the BNP-Jamaat alliance has caused many incidents, including arson attacks,"" she told reporters. In response to a question, Hasina said that India is a “trusted friend” of Bangladesh. ""We are very lucky...India is our trusted friend. During our Liberation War, they supported us not only that after 1975, when we lost our whole family - father, mother, brothers, everyone (in a military coup) - and only we two (Hasina and her younger sister Rehana) survived... they gave us shelter. So, we have our best wishes to the people of India,"" she told reporters. In August 1975, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, his wife and their three sons were assassinated in their home by military officers. His daughters Hasina and Rehana survived the purge as they were abroad. In response to a question on how acceptable the election will be while the BNP is boycotting it, Hasina said that her responsibility is towards the people. ""Whether people accept this election or not it is important to me. So, I don't care about their (foreign media) acceptance. No matter what did the terrorist party say or not?"" she said. The 27 political parties that contested the elections include the opposition Jatiya Party. The rest are members of the ruling Awami League-led coalition, which experts dub as ""satellite parties."" A total of 119.6 million registered voters were eligible to vote at Sunday's polls in more than 42,000 polling stations, according to the country’s Election Commission. More than 1,500 candidates from 27 political parties were contesting in the election, besides 436 independent candidates. Over 100 foreign observers, including three from India, monitored the 12th general election, which was held under tight security. More than 7.5 lakh members of law enforcement agencies and security forces were deployed to ensure law and order during the polls. Former Election Commissioner Brig Gen (retd) Sakhawat Hussain termed Sunday's polls a unique one compared to the previous two elections. ""This time the election is taking place between candidates from the same party in the name of independents and dummies. As a result, voters are less interested in the polls,"" said Sakhawat. ""So, it is a unique model election … Results of the election are certain, everybody knows who is going to win. The only uncertain thing is who will be in the opposition bench,"" he added. On Friday, the UN Special Rapporteur, Clement Nyaletsossi Voule, said he was ""deeply disturbed"" by the repressive environment surrounding the polls in Bangladesh.
