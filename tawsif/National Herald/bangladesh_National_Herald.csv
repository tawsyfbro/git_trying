https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/international/how-is-myanmars-civil-war-impacting-bangladesh,How is Myanmar's civil war impacting Bangladesh?,"Fighting between Myanmar's junta and the Arakan Army (AA) rebel group in western Myanmar's Rakhine state has intensified. Casualties have also been recorded in Bangladesh, with two people killed by an errant mortar round this month and several injured by gunshots from across the border. Rebel fighters have recently taken control of the Myanmar border region, and are seeking to oust junta forces from elsewhere in the state.This comes as a heavy blow for the Myanmar's ruling junta, which seized power in February 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi to find itself embroiled in a wide-scale civil war.The Arakan Army is the military wing of the Rakhine ethnic minority that seeks autonomy from Myanmar's central government. It has been attacking army outposts in Rakhine state since November 2023.Bangladesh is a predominantly Muslim country, which shares a 271-kilometer (168 miles) border with Buddhist-dominated Myanmar.Bangladesh is also the home of more than a million mostly Muslim  Rohingya refugees, which have been fleeing Myanmar for decades, and especially after Myanmar launched a brutal ""clearance operation"" in Rakhine state against them in 2017.Talking to DW, several Rohingya refugees in the coastal Bangladeshi town of Cox's Bazar commented on the success of the AA rebels with skepticism.  They do not believe that predominantly Buddhist rebel force is willing to do much to improve their fate, even if the rebels manage to oust the junta.""Buddhists have indeed been fighting against the Myanmar government in Rakhine, but we want citizenship upon return,"" Rashid, a Rohingya camp leader, told DW.""We have never heard from [the AA] that they will take us back by providing us citizenship.""However, Bangladeshi security expert M Sakhawat Hossain is more optimistic. The retired general points to pledges made by Myanmar's National Unity Government (NUG) to ensure safe, voluntary and dignified repatriation of Rohingya from Bangladesh.The NUG is a shadow government comprised out of activists and elected ministers who were ousted by the military coup.The body enjoys a good deal of international support and has plans of taking power in Naypyidaw after the junta is defeated.""The United League of Arakan (ULA), the political wing of the Arakan Army, will rule Rakhine state if the junta government loses its battles against the rebels and the NUG takes control of Myanmar. The NUG supports the ULA, which means that the Rohingya community has a better chance to get citizenship under the NUG and ULA,"" Hossain told DW.He thinks that Bangladesh needs to develop informal communication with key decision-makers in Rakhine for the future.""I have been saying for years that Bangladesh needs to support the AA for its own interest. This support can be informal, like many other countries do. It's not important for Bangladesh what is happening in the whole of Myanmar, but what is happening in Rakhine and Chin states are very important for us in terms of security and refugee issues,"" he said.At the same time, Bangladesh must be cautious in reaching out to rebels in any way, according to Michael Kugelman, South Asia director of the Washington-based Wilson Center think tank.""[Bangladesh] needs workable relations with the junta for the sake of border security cooperation and negotiations over the Rohingya. If Dhaka opens up channels with the rebels and the junta knows this, that could have deleterious implications for Dhaka's interests,"" he told DW.Kugelman acknowledged that the rebels are making rapid gains against the junta. But this could push the junta to resort to even more brutal tactics, and that could in turn intensify the conflict and increase spillover effects in Bangladesh.""AA gains or control in Rakhine may make conditions better for the Rohingya, but it could also make things more difficult,"" Kugelman said. The junta could interpret any initiative to repatriate the Rohingya refugees as a signal of cooperation between the Muslim group and the Buddhist rebels, which could ""entail fresh threats to Rohingya communities,"" he told DW.Meanwhile, Rohingya in Rakhine's Maungdaw area remain trapped amid fierce fighting between the junta forces and the AA rebels, Nay San Lwin, a co-founder of the Free Rohingya Coalition, told DW""The junta is losing on the battlefield, and the Rohingya are running to save their lives while the Arakan Army is attempting to take full control of the region,"" he said.""In Buthidaung and Maungdaw townships, approximately 270,000 Rohingya are remaining. In the entire Rakhine state, there are approximately 600,000 Rohingya, including about 130,000 confined to camps,"" he added.Nay runs one of the biggest Rohingya information hubs from Frankfurt, Germany. He thinks that the remaining Rohingya in Mynamar will attempt to flee the civil war, but would avoid Bangladesh.""Rohingya in the region are very cautious about fleeing to Bangladesh. Many of their fellow Rohingya have been trapped in Bangladeshi camps for several years, and the prospect of repatriation is uncertain,"" he told DW.""Only those in need of medical attention are attempting to flee to seek treatment in Bangladesh due to insufficient medical staff at Maungdaw Hospital. According to residents, the surgeon has left,"" Nay added.And Bangladesh, already overwhelmed by continuous waves of refugees, is not in the mood to accept anyone from Myanmar at the moment.""Our Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) and coast guard have intensified their petrol at the border so that no one from Myanmar could infiltrate into Bangladesh,"" Muhammad Shaheen Imran, the deputy commissioner of Cox's Bazar, told DW.Read the original article here",Fighting between Myanmar's junta and rebel groups in Rakhine state is growing more intense.

https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/politics/why-modi-is-welcoming-the-bangladesh-election-result,Why Modi is welcoming the Bangladesh election result,"Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her Awami League party won a landslide victory in Bangladesh's general election, a result that was widely expected as the polls were boycotted by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its allies.The Awami League secured 223 of the country's 300 parliamentary seats.Hasina will be prime minister for the fifth time in total, and the fourth time in a row, making her the world's longest-serving female head of government. India has welcomed the results, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulating Hasina for her victory.""We are committed to further strengthen our enduring and people-centric partnership with Bangladesh,"" Modi wrote on X, formerly Twitter.Hasina's victory in Bangladesh is important for India's security interests, analysts say. The countries share a 4,100-kilometer-long (2,500-mile) porous border, which is an easy pathway for infiltration, human trafficking, and terrorist elements. Bangladesh shares the border with the Indian states of West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. ""Given the deteriorating situation in Myanmar, it becomes more important that India and Bangladesh remain close security partners,"" C Raja Mohan, a foreign policy expert and professor at Singapore's Institute of South Asian Studies, told DW.Myanmar's civil war, with a rebel offensive posing a threat to the military junta's grip on power, has led to growing concerns about a spillover of tensions into border areas in India's north-east.""Given the fact that India's 'neighbourhood first' policy is in a quandary, the Awami League's return to power provides some level of stability on the eastern front. This is important given the continuing turmoil in Myanmar, which has its intense ramification in the northeastern states like Manipur,"" Shanthie Mariet D'Souza, founder of independent research forum Mantraya, told DW.Looking at the greater region, Mohan said India would like Bangladesh to become a fulcrum for regional cooperation in the Bay of Bengal littoral linking South and Southeast Asia.""At the end of the day, New Delhi's main consideration is that Bangladesh, or for that matter, any neighbour, does not do anything that hurts India's security. That is the red line that Dhaka under Hasina has respected,"" added Mohan.D'Souza believes there were no surprises in the election results given that the BNP had already boycotted it.""New Delhi remains unconcerned about the backsliding of democracy in Bangladesh, given the fact that Sheikh Hasina's overwhelming victory assures the continuation of strong ties,"" she said.India ""had rooted for such an outcome and had expressed opposition to attempts by the US to press Dhaka on human rights issues as well as Sheikh Hasina's authoritarianism,"" D'Souza added.Critics say Hasina has tried to turn Bangladesh into a one-party state and that her crackdown on political opponents and civil society groups has been severe.""However, domestic political stability will remain elusive in Bangladesh, despite the election results in favour of the Awami League,"" D'Souza said.""This may translate to a significant level of political violence and chaos and their cumulative impact on Bangladesh's slowing economy. All these can have potential repercussions on India's security,"" she added.Foreign policy expert Mohan said that despite concerns over democratic backsliding, alternatives to Hasina are seen as a ""bigger threat"" to ""peace and prosperity in the region"".Anil Wadhwa, a former Indian ambassador, told DW that India hopes for continuity in its strong ties with Bangladesh under Hasina's leadership.""India will look forward to an overall improvement in the relationship with Bangladesh and expects that economic and defence ties will increase by leaps and bounds,"" said Wadhwa.In recent years, both India and China have expanded their economic stakes in Bangladesh, which is being folded into the two countries' growing geopolitical rivalry.The big question is how Dhaka manages the competing expectations of India and China.Under the Hasina government, Bangladesh has tried to balance these outside influences, accepting aid and partnership offers, while trying to avoid dependence.Bilateral trade between India and Bangladesh exceeded $15 billion (€13.71 billion) in 2021-22. India recognizes Bangladesh as a vital eastern buffer, and provides critical support in ports and power grid access, essential for national growth.On the other hand, Bangladesh's two-way trade with China exceeded $25 billion (€22.85 billion) in 2022.China is also financing large infrastructure projects, with Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) financed infrastructure projects surpassing $10 billion.Hasina's election means ""continuity and stability and there will be a momentum in bilateral relations between India and Bangladesh that have huge potential going forward,"" Veena Sikri, a former Indian high commissioner in Bangladesh, told DW.","Sheikh Hasina winning a 4th consecutive term allows India a sense of continuity and stability for regional security, so it can ignore any democratic backsliding",None,None,None,DW,bangladesh,2024-01-12 21:51:00,2024-01-12 22:21:00

https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/national/bangladesh-poll-verdict-a-double-whammy-for-india,Bangladesh poll verdict a double-whammy for India,"Sheikh Hasina's expression of gratitude, thanking India for standing by her through thick and thin, can barely gloss over New Delhi's actual and progressive loss of influence over the ruling Awami League, which on Monday, 8 January won a record fourth consecutive term in office after winning a somewhat controversial election minus the principal Opposition coalition.India's predictable endorsement of the poll-verdict, that gave Awami League 223 seats in a 300-member House and Independents fielded by it winning 62 seats, is crucial for Hasina because others applauding her return are the authoritarian regimes in Russia and China with no opposition.For the world's most populous democracy India, having to endorse a one-sided election and one-party governance is particularly embarrassing. ""India is going the US way -- democracy at home and support for dictatorships abroad for strategic considerations,"" said former intelligence official Benu Ghosh.With the Islamist Opposition coalition, which has been buoyed by a poor voter turnout that it sees as support for its poll boycott call, hell bent on continuing violent street agitations to oust her--and the reaction of Western democracies likely to be less-than-welcoming if not totally hostile--Hasina will have to count on India to weather the crisis of legitimacy in the days following the polls.But will India miss its trusted friends, the old guard in the Hasina cabinet, almost all of whom were missing from the list of candidates after distribution of ticket? If India has to re-build bridges with the new incumbents in the Hasina cabinet, many of them known for their leaning towards Beijing as a counterweight to New Delhi, then it will be of concern to India. Bangladesh could well be the last nail in India's neighbourhood coffin after pro-Chinese regimes have taken over the South Asian landscape from Nepal to Maldives.With the Awami League now firmly under Hasina's all powerful advisor Salman F Rahman all set to marginalise the party's traditional middle class, pro-liberation and India-friendly leadership, Delhi can only retain its foothold if it manages to persuade her to induct some of them into Hasina's cabinet through quotas meant for technocrats and women.But if it remains content with odd favours like the lucrative power purchase deal given to the Adanis, it will be looking at a Bangladesh government, which will be pro-Indian in appearance but not in substance.Salman Rahman is relentlessly pursuing a radical Pakistan-type Islamist agenda like operationalising 560 Model Mosques cum Islamic Cultural Centres which will seek to dominate the syncretic and intrinsically secular Bengali social and cultural space that translated into the strong India connect.The withering away of the BNP in the legislative political space paves the way for a surge of radical Islamist groups like Jamaat e Islami and Hifazat e Islam, the latter being directly patronised by Rahman's trusted lieutenant and information minister Hasan Mahmud. This growing Islamist lobby in Awami League seeks to justify pursuit of soft Islam to handle the party's future in a neighborhood dominated by India's rising Hindutva.As many as 92 per cent of Awami League's new MPs are fabulously rich and crorepatis because they mostly come from business backgrounds and a lot of them owe their wealth to trading with Chinese companies. That translates into a strong pro-Chinese lobby alongside the pro-Islamist one in the Awami League that does not augur well for India. Hasina's pitch for China and Russia is as much because they have the UN Security Council veto as to her liking for their one-party state model in preference to India's multiparty democracy.The Bangladesh Parliament will now look like an extended national Council of the ruling Awami League with 61 Independents from the party emerging as the main 'Opposition bloc' to the League's 223 elected MPs in a 300-member House.""Effectively this election has turned out to be a firm step towards a one-party state,"" said Bangladesh analyst Debashis Nandi.In a first-time move to give the polls a participatory flavour after principal Opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) boycotted the polls and ally Jamaat-e-Islami failed to regain Election Commission registration, the Awami League allowed dissidents denied official nomination to contest as'Independents ' without holding the threat of disciplinary action as before.""Now that 61 of them have won and started jockeying for cabinet positions, the parliament will clearly have the one-party look of Chinese National People’s Congress rather than an Indian parliament or the UK House of Commons or the US Senate,"" says Nandi, who teaches politics in an Indian University.But PM Sheikh Hasina's advisor Salman F Rahman sought to justify the absence of Opposition by referring to the Indian situation.""The Indian parliament does not have an Opposition leader because the Congress failed to get the mandatory ten percent seats needed to get that. Should we call India then a one-party state,"" Rahman was quoted by top Bangladesh portal bdnews24.com as saying.Rahman won a whopping victory against Jatiya Party's Salma Islam in Dhaka's Dohar constituency in a poll where under-age children were caught on camera voting by turns.""When you need such fraudulent practices even in a largely Opposition-less election, it says a lot about the legitimacy of this poll exercise,"" said the country's top rights activist and economist Badiul Alam Majumder who runs the 'Citizens for Good Governance '. He also pointed to 'desperate efforts' by the Bangladesh Election Commission to up the voter turnout statistics in 'a rather strange way'.""At 3 pm on Sunday, the Election Commission said only 27 per cent had voted. Then after one hour, it put the figure at 40 per cent. This points to fudging turnout statistics,"" said Majumder in a poll discussion on BBC Bengali service. Even at 40 per cent, the turnout was half of the polling recorded in the last parliament poll five years ago.A boycott call by principal opposition BNP and threat of violence to back the call may explain the low turnout. ""But voter apathy really explains this low turnout because everyone knew the results beforehand,"" said leading editor Nurul Kabir in an interview to Deutsche Welle Bengali service.The Jatiya Party established by late military dictator H.M Ershad is set to be the official opposition in parliament again, commanding just 11 seats, because its candidates have lost in half of the 26 constituencies left by the Awami League in a seat-sharing deal.""We have become the sacrificial lamb in this election because it was marred by massive poll fraud and many of our deserving candidates were denied sure victories by the Awami League, "" said Jatiya Party chief G M Quader, brother of the late Ershad.The 'Independent' candidates of the Awami League have won nearly six times as many seats as the Jatiya Party at 61. The Awami League has secured an absolute majority with 223 out of 299 constituencies.“There should have been a strong opposition. Not just in name only. We saw some subordinate and domesticated oppositions in our country. Such oppositions are ineffective and they play no role in flourishing democracy,” columnist Bibhu Ranjan Sarker was quoted by bdnews24.com as saying.“Some of the independents may not join the Awami League, but most of them will. So, it will actually be a one-party parliament.”(Subir Bhaumik is a former BBC and Reuters correspondent who worked as Senior Editor in Bangladesh's top portal bdnews24.com and later at Myanmar’s Mizzima media.

https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/international/us-says-bangladesh-elections-not-free-or-fair-un-also-voices-concern-over-violence-irregularities,"US says Bangladesh elections not free or fair, UN also voices concern over violence, irregularities","A day after Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's party emerged victorious at the polls, the US and UN voiced concern over violence and reports of irregularities on the day of elections, with Washington noting that the polls were not free or fair and regretted that not all parties participated in the ballot.The US State Department, in a press statement Monday,8 January said that Washington remains concerned by the arrests of thousands of political opposition members and by reports of irregularities on elections day in Bangladesh.“The United States shares the view with other observers that these elections were not free or fair and we regret that not all parties participated,” the State Department said.While noting that Hasina's Awami League won a majority of seats in the January 7 parliamentary elections, the State Department said that Washington condemns violence that took place during elections and in the months leading up to it.“We encourage the Government of Bangladesh to credibly investigate reports of violence and to hold perpetrators accountable. We also urge all political parties to reject violence,” it said.The State Department added that the US supports the people of Bangladesh and their aspirations for democracy, freedom of peaceful assembly, and freedom of expression.“Looking ahead, the United States remains committed to partnering with Bangladesh to advance our shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific, to supporting human rights and civil society in Bangladesh, and to deepening our people-to-people and economic ties,” it said.UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk called on Bangladesh’s newly elected government to take steps to renew the country’s commitment to democracy and human rights, voicing distress that the environment for Sunday’s poll was marred by violence and repression of opposition candidates and supporters.“In the months leading up to the vote, thousands of opposition supporters have been detained arbitrarily or subjected to intimidation. Such tactics are not conducive to a truly genuine process,” Türk said.The top UN human rights official noted that democracy was “hard won” in Bangladesh and ""must not become cosmetic.”Underlining that Bangladesh has been a role model of development, Türk said he “fervently hopes this will translate into the political and institutional spheres too. The future of all Bangladeshis is at stake.”The UN official noted that mass arrests, threats, enforced disappearances, blackmailing and surveillance were all methods reportedly used by law enforcement officials prior to the ballot, which was boycotted by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Acts of political violence, including arson attacks allegedly committed by opposition groups, have also been reported.Around 25,000 opposition supporters have been arrested, including key party leaders, since October, the UN official said. At least 10 opposition supporters reportedly died – or were killed – in custody in the last two months, raising serious concerns about possible torture or harsh conditions of detention, the UN Human Rights chief said.He said many human rights defenders have been forced to go into hiding, and some have fled the country, while dozens of suspected enforced disappearance cases have been reported, mostly in November.“These incidents must be independently investigated, and those responsible must be brought to justice in fair and transparent trials,” Türk said. “Violations and irregularities during the campaign and on election day itself should also be thoroughly and effectively investigated.”Türk implored the government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the human rights of all Bangladeshis are fully taken into account, and to strengthen the underpinnings of a truly inclusive democracy in the country.Associate spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Florencia Soto Niño, in response to a question on whether the UN believes the elections were free and fair, said, “We have seen the situation that's unfolding there. The Secretary-General continues to follow what's happening. He notes the opposition’s decision to boycott the elections.”She said the UN chief is “obviously concerned” about reports of incidents of violence prior to, and during the elections. Guterres calls on all parties to reject all forms of violence and to ensure that human rights and the rule of law are fully respected. “This is essential for the consolidation of democracy and economic prosperity there,” she said.In response to another question, she said it is essential that the Bangladesh government fosters an environment of democracy. “Respect and reject all forms of violence, and obviously ensure that human rights are respected there,” she said.Awami League (AL) won 223 seats in the 300-member Parliament on Sunday, 7 January in the polls boycotted by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the main opposition.The Bangladesh government had invited a large number of foreign observers from India and other countries, as well as multilateral organisations, to observe the elections.","The US calls for an investigation into reports of violence while the UN  criticised the use of ""tactics"" such as mass arrests, threats,  and surveillance by law enforcement officials",None,None,None,PTI,bangladesh,2024-01-09 08:51:00,2024-01-09 09:21:00
https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/international/bangladesh-whats-next-after-pm-sheikh-hasinas-reelection,Bangladesh: What's next after PM Sheikh Hasina's re-election?,"Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina won another term in power in a contentious general election that was boycotted by the main opposition and drew a low turnout. Hasina secured a fourth consecutive term in power on Monday, with her Awami League party taking three-quarter of the seats in Parliament following a controversial election. The vote was boycotted by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), who described it as ""illegitimate"". The BNP had demanded a neutral caretaker government to oversee the polls, saying that Hasina's government could not hold free and fair polls. But the ruling party rejected the calls.The election commission on Monday said the Awami League won 222 out of 298 parliamentary seats in Sunday's polls. Authorities suspended voting in two constituencies, one because of violence during the election, and the other over the death of an independent candidate due to natural causes a week ago.  Critics say that Hasina's control over parliament is even higher than the 222-figure suggests, as many smaller opposition groups and independent candidates are allied with the ruling party.Jasmin Lorch, a senior researcher at the German Institute of Development and Sustainability (IDOS), labeled it an ""autocratic election"".""There was no real opposition party in the electoral race, and the Awami League government controlled the electoral process entirely,"" she said. ""Overall, this was an autocratic election, which was aimed at cementing the power of the ruling party and creating a democratic façade for what is, in fact, an autocratic political regime.""What's behind the low voter turnout?Bangladeshis largely stayed away from the election, which was roiled by political violence and international scrutiny. Turnout was low at just 41.8 per cent, according to the election commission, compared with over 80 per cent in the last election in 2018.Some say the voter participation was even lower. When DW reporters visited four polling centers in the capital Dhaka on Sunday, they were largely empty. Their presiding officers said that voter turnout at these centers was around 20 per cent.""The low election turnout indicates that many Bangladeshi citizens did not consider the process as legitimate and did not view it as a meaningful way to express their political preferences,"" Lorch said.This is the third general election in Bangladesh in the last 15 years that was tarnished by credibility concerns. The previous two votes — held in 2018 and 2014, respectively — were also widely seen as flawed. They were beset by violence and widespread allegations of vote-rigging, which authorities denied. The BNP participated in the 2018 vote but kept away in 2014.Concerns over democracy and human rightsIn the run-up to the elections, Bangladeshi authorities were accused of clamping down on the opposition using trumped-up charges following deadly anti-government protests in late October.The BNP said police detained nearly 25,000 of its activists and that many more are on the run. The BNP's 78-year-old leader Khaleda Zia has been living under house arrest, and many other senior party officials are also behind bars or in exile.Over the 15 years, rights groups and critics have repeatedly accused Hasina's government of stifling dissent, restricting free speech and press freedom, and committing human rights violations. And after the latest election result, Sultan Mohammed Zakaria, a Bangladesh expert at Amnesty International, fears the country could see a ""profound reshaping of its social and political order.""""Following three contentious elections, the current regime appears to have consolidated its grip on power,"" he told DW. ""The blurring of lines between the state, society, and economy, a trend that began with the one-sided 2014 elections, might lead to their complete merger.""Zakaria said such a development risks worsening the political polarization and turmoil. ""This phenomenon, observed in various nations, often sees a strong political dictatorship evolve into a totalitarian system where a specific group dominates every aspect of a state,"" he underlined. ""Such political strangleholds typically breed heightened violence, a withering of human rights, and global isolation.""How could it affect Dhaka's diplomatic ties?The situation may also challenge some of Dhaka's diplomatic ties, particularly with the US. Relations between the two sides have been tense since Washington vowed to impose visa restrictions on anyone disrupting the electoral process. Hasina then accused the US of trying to plot her ouster.Bangladesh expert Lorch said, ""there is wide consensus in the US and Europe that this was not a democratic election. ""The EU, for instance, did not send an election observation mission because the conditions for a free and fair election and for the mission itself to operate freely were not in place,"" she noted. ""The repression of the opposition is generally recognized and rejected in the US and European capitals.""Sultan Mohammed Zakaria, a Bangladesh expert at Amnesty International, pointed out that the US has already taken steps to put pressure on Dhaka over human rights violations. ""The US has responded by imposing sanctions on Bangladesh's Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and enforcing visa restrictions on individuals accused of undermining democracy,"" he said.But, he added, that the measures have so far had little impact. ""Despite these measures, the election was held and widely criticized, indicating that the current Western strategy may not be effective,"" Zakaria said.Hasina says the economy is her focusHasina said on Monday that Bangladesh's economic development was her main aim in the next five years. ""Each political party has the right to take a decision. The absence of one party in an election does not mean democracy is absent,"" Hasina told reporters.Hasina is often credited with presiding over Bangladesh's impressive growth in recent years. But the country's economy is currently facing an array of problems. The prices of food and fuel have been surging, threatening to push many Bangladeshis back into poverty. At the same time, foreign exchange reserves have dropped to less than three months' worth of imports.The garment industry, which is crucial to Bangladesh's economy accounting for around 85 per cent of its $55 billion (€50.2 billion) in annual exports, has witnessed a wave of labor protests.""So far, there are no signs that the Awami League government will be able to tackle the economic situation. If it was able to curb the price hike of essentials, it would most likely have done so before the elections to gain popular support and, thereby, improve the electoral turnout,"" Lorch said.""If the economic situation of large parts of the population does not improve, the government might face social unrest, especially if the opposition joins in and increasingly mobilizes around social demands.""","Bangladeshis largely stayed away from the election, which was marred by political violence and international scrutiny",None,None,None,DW,bangladesh,2024-01-08 22:10:00,2024-01-08 22:40:00
