(File) At least 95 Myanmar border guards, some of them wounded, have fled to Bangladesh over the last few days as fighting intensifies between rebel forces in Myanmar and the junta regime, officials in Bangladesh said on Monday. Since mounting a coup against an elected government in 2021, the junta is facing its biggest challenge, trying to contain a bloody rebellion which has seen allied anti-junta groups backed by a pro-democracy parallel government seize control of several military posts and towns. The sound of gunfire could be heard from across the Myanmar border in Bangladesh's southeastern tourist district of Cox's Bazar, where nearly one million members of the Muslim minority from Myanmar live in bamboo-and-plastic hut camps after fleeing a military crackdown there in 2017.  Members of the Myanmar Border Guard Police (BGP) entered Bangladesh with their weapons and 15 of them had bullet wounds when they crossed the border, Shariful Islam, a spokesman for Border Guard Bangladesh, said on Monday, adding that the wounded received treatment at different hospitals. The BGP troops could be accommodated in the nearby district of Bandarban before they are sent back to Myanmar, said Mohammed Mizanur Rahman, Bangladesh's refugee relief and repatriation commissioner based in Cox's Bazar. ""I have been asked if the BGP can be sheltered safely in transit camps that were built in Bandarban for repatriating Rohingya refugees. The camps are empty,"" Rahman said. Bullets and mortar shells from across the Myanmar border landed on Bangladesh territory on Monday, killing at least two people, a government official in Cox's Bazar said. ""A Bangladeshi woman and a Rohingya were killed and a child injured near the border by a mortar shell fired from Myanmar,"" said Mohammad Shamsud Douza, the deputy Bangladesh government official in charge of refugees. Many residents on the Bangladeshi side of the border have fled to the houses of relatives further away from violence out of fear, he said. Panic has gripped the refugee camps in Myanmar with many waiting to cross over to Bangladesh as supply chains have been cut off due to the ongoing conflict, according to Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. ""Now and then we hear the sound of gunshots from Myanmar. Some of the Rohingya Muslims want to flee here as they are living in constant fear without basic needs,"" Rohingya refugee Oli Hossain said.

""I'm truly realistic person ...and for now we should be happy and satisfied when continuously participating at the AFC Asian Cup. The reason for saying that is very simple and logical,"" Stimac wrote in his report. ""...how to expect our NT (national team) to do well while our best ISL teams are losing heavily in AFC Champion League and suffering defeats in AFC Cup club competitions against teams from Bangladesh and Maldives?"" Stimac was spot on in his comments as Indian clubs rarely make it to the knock-out rounds of the continental level tournaments.  He also said that India was the only country among the 24 participants in the Asian Cup without a single player playing in a major football league in the world. ""How we can expect more from our boys if we had never in our history qualified for the Asian Cup in U18/U20/U23?

Mridha picked up 5/43 in 8 overs to help Bangladesh restrict India to 251/7 in 50 overs but his team lost the match by 84 runs after being shot out for 167 in 455 overs.

While India disposed off Bangladesh by 84 runs in what turned out to be an easier than expected opener, Ireland game will provide them with an opportunity to play differently before tougher opposition comes calling during the Super Six phase starting next week. Ireland are coming into the game with a defeat against Bangladesh after beating minnows USA in the opening game.  For India, more than battling the opposition, it will be about raising the bar for themselves and playing the 50-over game, keeping the modern approach in mind, compared to the early 1990s style of play. The skipper Uday Saharan, who scored 64 and top scorer Adarsh Singh (76), had strike-rates of 79 and 68 respectively, which is slightly unacceptable in modern times. That India had two terrific but vastly different left-arm spinners Saumy Kumar Pandey and Musheer Khan doing a fantastic job for them meant coach Hrishikesh Kanitkar didn't have much to worry about. Advertisement One hopes that Saumy, easily the best bowler by a distance in the first game, doesn't have too much of a shoulder problem that forced him to take a temporary break in the first game in between his first and second spells. On a slowish Bloemfontein track, Indian batters would need to rotate the strike better and also find more gaps in the Powerplay overs.  There would be a lot of talent scouts, who are keenly watching the 'Boys in Blue' and with a mega IPL auctions lined up next year, people like Saharan, Adrash and Priyanshu Moliya will need to up their game in order to grab eye balls from men who matter. Something only Sachin Dhas was able to do in first game with his cameo that took India past 250-run mark. Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com All eyes will be on Priyanshu, especially, as he is the only player in the side, with two Ranji Trophy tons for Baroda already under his belt. His defensive mindset in the first game was baffling. For Ireland, their new ball bowlers Oliver Riley, Reuben Wilson and Carson McCullough could ask some probing questions and both Arshin Kulkarni, who has an IPL contract, and Sarfaraz Khan's younger sibling Musheer are due for a big score.

India,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/assam-would-have-been-part-of-bangladesh-not-india-if-amit-shah-4900286, Assam Would Have Been Part Of Bangladesh And Not India If...: Amit Shah ,"January 20, 2024, 09:52 PM",2024-01-20,20-1-2024,"He also appealed to the people that they should rise above the differences of languages (File) Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday said that Assam would have been a part of Bangladesh and not of India if Ahom Commander Lachit Barphukan and other rulers had not thwarted the aggression of the Mughals and other invaders. The main reason why Assam could remain a part of India is that the army of several invaders-from Khilji to Aurangzeb- were defeated and sent back, Mr Shah said here while launching the book 'Assam's Braveheart-Lachit Barphukan'. The book is written by eminent author Arup Kumar Dutta in English and has been translated into 23 scheduled languages.  ""There are many such tales of valour and victory in the country which have not properly evaluated by historians but now they are being given their due recognition so that the next generation gets inspired,"" he said. The minister also said, ''Earlier, history was written and taught to us from the British point of view and there were only passing references of heroes who struggled hard for the 'swabhiman' (self-respect) and 'samman' (honour) of the country."" The effort of the Assam government in getting the book translated into 23 scheduled languages is indeed laudable and it will serve as a reference book for students and researchers who will know more about him and the history of this part of the country, Mr Shah said. Referring to the title of the book, the minister said that he has no complaints against its content but has reservations about the title, as ''Lachit is not a braveheart of Assam alone but of the entire country''. He was a commander who led his soldiers from the front, mastered the art of guerilla and river warfare, having perhaps fought the biggest war on the river, and even his arch-rival Ram Singh of the Mughal army had praised him saying that he was yet to fight against a soldier of Lachit's stature, Mr Shah said. ''Besides, he (Lachit) was known to take people from all communities as his soldiers and the killing of his maternal uncle for laziness along with his famed quote that his uncle was not above the country has gone down in history as exemplary show of courage and bravery,"" Mr Shah said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's aim to launch the 'Azaadi ka Amrit Mahotsav' was manifold and the primary goal was to raise consciousness as well as awareness about the freedom struggle and also to bring to the fore the struggles of many in different parts of the country who played a pivotal role in ensuring the country's independence. ''There are many bravehearts and heroes in different parts of the country whose valour is not known outside their states but we are determined to take the stories of their lives to each state so that it inspires the future generation and in the next 25 years, people can help make India a leading country of the world,"" Mr Shah said. He urged the youth to raise the collective confidence of the nation so that it can become ''purna vikshit"" (fully developed) and ""atma nirbhar"" (self-reliant). The union minister further alleged that the Congress had created a ""divide among the people of the region"" but the prime minister with his policy of development and peace in the North East has ensured that the people gain confidence to take the nation towards the goal of becoming the most developed country in the world. He also appealed to the people that they should rise above the differences of languages and religion for the good of Assam and the North East. ''Language should not be considered as a point of dispute but of strength. We must respect different languages, literature and grammar and make it the strength of the nation'', he said. PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The publication of the book written in English and translated into 23 languages portrays the strength of the nation and its commitment to honour valour, Mr Shah added.

While the total of 251 for 7 didn't look big, the two Indian spinners choked the run-flow, shooting out 'Tiger Cubs' for a meagre 167 in 45.5 overs. Skipper Uday Saharan (64 off 94 balls) and left-handed opener Adarsh Singh (76 off 96 balls) hit half-centuries after Bangladesh invited the holders to take first strike. Saumy (4/24) was economical and bowled the lethal arm ball with a skiddy action while all-rounder Musheer (2/35) tossed it up and got enough drift to tighten the noose around Bangladeshi batters. Musheer, younger brother Mumbai's domestic stalwart Sarfaraz Khan, was a livewire on the field. He also effected a run-out.  What was impressive to see was no overt celebrations from either Saumy or Musheer, who carried on their job like thoroughbred professionals. It was a fairly ill-tempered match with players from both sides indulging in sledging as the two teams have history of tension across senior men, senior women and U-19 level. For Indian team, it was a sweet revenge after losing the Asia Cup semi-final to Bangladesh. Advertisement While the Indian batters found it difficult to get boundaries, the target was never below par as average score of teams batting first in Youth ODIs (U-19 ODI) at this ground was 201, and the highest successful chase being 243. In fact, India's 251/7 on the day was the third highest score at this ground. The team's designated finisher Sachin Dhas showed admirable technique and temperament during death overs with a nice little unbeaten cameo of 26 off 20 balls that took the score past 250-run mark. The pulled six off seamer Rohanat Doullah Borson was a treat for the eyes.  This despite allowing Bangladeshi bowlers to bowl dot balls worth 26 overs during their innings. Left-arm seamer Maruf Mridha (5/43) did damage at the start and during slog overs by bowling in right areas but would be a bit miffed with his skipper, who got his calculations wrong and didn't let him complete his quota of 10 overs. Advertisement Possessing a skiddy action like Mustafizur Rahaman, Maruf varied his lengths, bowled closer to stumps at the start and mixed cutters with wide yorkers at the death to make life difficult for the India colts. The foundation of the Indian innings was laid by Adarsh (76 off 96 balls) and skipper Saharan (64 off 94 balls), who added 116 runs for the third wicket in nearly 23.5 overs. Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The two youngsters didn't look comfortable against the Bangladesh spinners -- offie Sheikh Paevez Jibon (0/39) and left-arm spinner Mahfuzur Rahaman Rabby (1/41).

Clashes have rocked Myanmar's western Rakhine and Chin states since the Arakan Army (AA) attacked security forces in November, ending a ceasefire that had largely held since the junta's 2021 coup. The Arakan Army is one of a dozen armed ethnic minority groups in Myanmar's border regions, many of whom have battled the military since independence from Britain in 1948 over autonomy and control of lucrative resources.  The group said late Sunday that Arakan Army fighters had seized the town of Paletwa in Chin state, around 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the Bangladesh border. Paletwa sits on the Kaladan river, which a New Delhi-backed infrastructure initiative hopes to use to link India's landlocked northeast to the Bay of Bengal. The Arakan Army posted pictures it said showed its fighters outside the town's police station and general administration office. It said it was now in control of all of Paletwa township, which had a population of over 64,000 people according to the 2014 census. The Arakan Army also said it had captured six military bases along the border with India's Mizoram state. AFP could not confirm the reports.

""Beehives on the Fence"" was launched in November last year as part of the central government's ""Vibrant Village Programme"", and according to officials, it not only aims at preventing cross-border crimes but also generating employment for locals through apiculture and horticulture. The flowering plants will also create an ecosystem for the bees to pollinate, a senior official of the AYUSH department said.  This stretch along the border has been named ""Arogya Path"" (healthy street) and QR codes have been affixed which when scanned will give details about the plants, the official said, requesting anonymity. He added that the ""path"" doubles up as a nursery. Villagers of Kadirpur in Nadia have been engaged in different works such as planting and watering the fruit-bearing and aromatic medicinal plants, and digging pits to extend the hedge, as part of the first phase of the project. An official of the Border Security Force (BSF) said 40 bee boxes have been fixed on poles of the metal fence over the last two months with the help of the National Medicinal Plants Board (NMPB). The board, which comes under the Union AYUSH Ministry, has committed its resources of experts, manpower, and plants for the ""unique initiative"", the official said and added that more bee boxes have reached the area and are being installed. The bees in the hives, the BSF feels, will act as a deterrent to cross-border criminals and smugglers who come closer or dare to cut the fence and breach it for smuggling cattle, narcotics, gold, silver, and other items. Experts and officials from various central and state government departments are engaged in the project. Tulsi, Ekangi, Satmuli, Ashwagandha, and Aloe Vera are among the plants that will make the hedge. More saplings, around 60,000, are in the process of being sent to the area by the NMPB and the AYUSH ministry, the AYUSH department official said. On creation of employment, the official said through this project, locals can earn through apiculture and horticulture. Commanding Officer (CO) of the BSF's 32nd Battalion, Sujeet Kumar, who devised the initiative, said the enthusiasm of locals and authorities towards the project is unparalleled. ""We thought of adding this new dimension of work under the Vibrant Village Programme, which was envisaged by the prime minister, and the BSF wishes to improve the living standards of the people residing in the border area through beekeeping and cultivation of medicinal plants, and using bees for border security work,"" he said. ""We are getting good help from the AYUSH ministry and from a local expert in beekeeping works. We are hopeful and confident that our experiment will be successful and effective,"" the BSF commandant told PTI. Personnel of his battalion who patrol the border are providing support to volunteers by providing water tankers and field equipment, and even additional human resources. The NMPB's eastern regional-cum-facilitation center recently informed the BSF that it ""appreciates their idea of promotion of livelihood opportunity"" and will extend all support for cultivation of medicinal plants in this frontier area. The border force, which is tasked to guard the international front, has committed to villagers that the honey they extract from these beehives will be sold through an established setup and shops of the BSF wives welfare association.

(File) Sheikh Hasina was on Thursday sworn in as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh for the fifth term, days after her Awami League won an overwhelming majority in the general elections boycotted by the main opposition BNP and its allies. President Mohammad Shahabuddin administered the oath of office to 76-year-old Sheikh Hasina at a ceremony joined by politicians, foreign diplomats, civil society figures and senior civil and military officials at Bangabhaban Presidential Palace here. She will serve as the 12th Prime Minister; her fourth consecutive term and fifth overall term.  Sheikh Hasina, the daughter of Bangladesh's founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, has been ruling the strategically located South Asian nation since 2009. She is among the world's longest-serving female heads of government. Following the Prime Minister, the new members of the cabinet were sworn in by the president. Sheikh Hasina's party won 223 seats in the 300-member Parliament. Opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of ex-Prime Minister Khaleda Zia boycotted the elections after their demand for a non-party caretaker government to conduct the January 7 polls was rejected. Sheikh Hasina formed her government for the straight fourth term. She has inducted 25 ministers and 11 state ministers in her Cabinet. ""We have not got the (new) ministers and state ministers' portfolios yet but it is expected to be announced later Thursday,"" a cabinet division official told PTI.
