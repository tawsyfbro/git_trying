https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/false-communal-claims-about-murder-of-hindu-family-go-viral-fact-check,Murder of a Hindu Family in Bangladesh Given False Communal Spin,"A set of four graphic images of three corpses is being shared to claim that a Hindu family was allegedly killed by 'Islamists' in Bangladesh. Who shared it?: This claim was also shared by Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)'s Organiser magazine. (We have not added the archives of this claim due to its graphic nature.) Is this true?: The claim is false and there are no communal links in the murder. Bangladesh's news organisations reported that the three deceased were killed by a family member, identified as Rajiv Kumar Bhowmik. The local police informed the press that the accused killed his uncle's family over a financial dispute.How did we find out?: We ran a keyword search in both English and Bengali using the names of the alleged deceased in the claim. We came across multiple news reports by Bangladeshi media outlets. According to a report by the Dhaka Tribune from 30 January, bodies of three members of a family were recovered from their house on the day in Sirajganj, Bangladesh. The deceased were identified as Bikash Sarkar, his wife Swarna Rani Sarkar, and their daughter Paramita Sarker alias Tushi. These are the same names mentioned in the viral claim.What happened?: Prothomalo reported on 31 January that the name of the accused is Rajiv Kumar Bhowmik, who is the nephew of the deceased.Rajiv has now been arrested by the Sirajganj police. During the interrogation, he revealed the reason behind the triple murder. After receiving a business capital of 20 lakh takas from his uncle, Rajiv repaid about 26 lakh takas, along with business dividends. However, his uncle demanded an additional 35 lakh takas earned from the business, pressuring him to give him the amount within a week.The deceased went on to scold Rajiv's mother. Frustrated by this, Rajiv planned to kill Bikash and his entire family.Police's statement: Upon conducting a keyword search in Bengali on YouTube, we came across a video by Channel i News from 31 January, which showed a press conference by the police.Speaking in Bengali, Sirajganj Superintendent of Police Arifur Rahman Mandal briefed the press and said that the cause of the murder was over ""financial transactions.""The accused's primary target was his ""mama"" (uncle), but after not finding him at his place, Bhowmik proceeded to kill his cousin and his aunt. His uncle was also killed after he returned.The police also recovered a rod, which was the murder weapon. It was thrown into a lake after the act.The police concluded and said, ""After compiling all manual and digital evidence alongside his testimony, we have concluded that Rajiv has committed the murders.""None of the news reports discussed a communal angle in this case. Even the police did not mention anything about any communal tensions. The Quint has also reached out to the Sirajganj police for further inputs and the story will be updated once the response comes. Conclusion: Clearly, the murder of a Hindu family by their own relative has been given a false communal angle.

India, led by Rohit Sharma, dominated the initial days, but Ollie Pope's resilience turned the game on its head. His masterful innings of 196 runs shifted the momentum, leaving India with a challenging target of 231 runs.As the dust settles, India finds itself slipping down the World Test Championship rankings to the fifth spot. The disappointment is palpable, especially considering their mixed performance in the ongoing tournament. With two wins, two losses, and a draw, the Indian team faces a critical juncture in the championship.Attention now turns to the upcoming Test match in Vizag, where redemption beckons for the home team. Shubman Gill, in the spotlight for his struggles at the No. 3 position, carries the weight of expectations.

https://www.thequint.com/opinion/bangladesh-hasinas-win-a-relief-for-india-but-will-america-spoil-the-party,"Bangladesh: Hasina's Win a Relief for India, but Will America Spoil the Party?","Sheikh Hasina’s landslide victory in Bangladesh and her re-election for a fourth straight term as prime minister means an awful lot to New Delhi, especially after the rout of pro-India Ibrahim Solih at the hands of China-friendly Mohamed Muizzu in the Maldives a few months ago.Both Bangladesh and Maldives are in India’s immediate neighbourhood where New Delhi naturally wants friendly heads of state who would give top priority to India’s national interests and keep China, our biggest adversary, at arm’s length.As the 60-plus Independent MPs are in reality Awami Leaguers who were ordered to contest to make the polls appear inclusive, Hasina’s party has roughly 290 lawmakers, which is bizarre!Not surprisingly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the first world leader to telephone Hasina to congratulate her, flagging their warm personal ties and New Delhi’s high stakes in her triumph. Modi called her barely 30 minutes after chief election commissioner, Kazi Habibul Awal, formally declared the results.India’s High Commissioner, Pranay Verma, too beat all other ambassadors in Dhaka in presenting her a bouquet! Verma called on her before China’s envoy Yao Wen or Russia’s Alexander Mantytsky could, although both Beijing and Moscow backed her to the hilt in the run-up to the one-sided polls delegitimised further by the abysmally low 40 percent turn-out.Hasina, who has been in power since January 2009 without a break, is already the longest-serving head of state in South Asia. After helming Bangladesh for 15 years, now she is all set to break Jawaharlal Nehru’s record who was Prime Minister of India for 16 years, from 1947 to 1964 when he passed away. She has already left women leaders like India’s Indira Gandhi, Sri Lanka’s Srimavo Bandaranaike, Israel’s Golda Meir, and Britain’s Margaret Thatcher far behind by winning election after election.India can rest assured that for the next five years, terrorists are unlikely to sneak in through the 4000 km-plus frontier to wreak havoc. Connectivity, transshipment, and transit facilities to fast-track the economic development of the northeast are also assured. All in all, India knows that Hasina will grant it anything it desires, like the genie in the story of Aladdin.But India today faces two potential challenges in Bangladesh. Firstly, as Bangladesh’s friend, a clampdown by the United States and its Western allies on Hasina for conducting elections with the sole purpose of getting herself re-elected, will have consequences for India. A rift between Washington and New Delhi over Bangladesh will hurt India’s strategic and economic interests. Secondly, if the US-led West comes down hard on Hasina's government, Dhaka will inevitably seek comfort in China’s arms, weakening India’s hold over Bangladesh.As things stand, there is a strong possibility of the US giving Bangladesh a torrid time for holding sham elections. Within 24 hours of Modi congratulating Hasina for a job well done, the US State Department bluntly said that elections in Bangladesh were not free or fair. The State Department’s press statement stressed that “not all parties participated”, condemned the violence during elections as well in the months leading up to it, and told Dhaka to hold the perpetrators accountable.After such trenchant criticism, there is a high probability of the US clamping sanctions on Bangladesh as it had taken, along with the European Union and Western governments, a sharply critical view in the run-up to the polls, with Washington even warning of a visa ban on Bangladeshi government officials undermining credible elections.I see a distinct possibility of the US, the largest buyer of Bangladesh’s ready-made garment (RMG) multibillion-dollar industry, imposing trade sanctions for holding sham elections. Last month, a key garment supplier to the US was warned of sanctions in a letter of credit (LC) by a US buyer. According to published reports, the letter said that the buyer would not be liable for payment for a shipment in the event of the US government imposing trade sanctions.Sanctions on a key revenue earner like RMG will hit Bangladesh’s already stuttering economy hard and create hurdles for foreign direct investments and trade partnerships. The resultant unrest and political instability might drive the new government lacking the people’s mandate, to resort to repressive measures triggering a countrywide backlash against the Hasina regime propped up by a one-sided election. And God forbid, if Bangladesh burns, it will be a major challenge for India to insulate itself from the fire.(SNM Abdi is a distinguished journalist and ex-Deputy Editor of Outlook.

https://www.thequint.com/opinion/bangladesh-election-whats-next-for-sheikh-hasina-awami-league-bnp-boycott-india-us-china,"After Bangladesh Win, What’s Next for Sheikh Hasina, at Home and Abroad?","With so much attention on Bangladesh’s controversial election, it’s easy to overlook all the challenges confronting Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina post-polls. She’ll have her hands full with both security and foreign policy—though her job will be somewhat easier on the foreign policy front, where much of the non-Western world will welcome her return. One of Hasina’s most immediate challenges will be managing the risks of post-election unrest. The polls have exacerbated the country’s dangerous political polarization. The AL is galvanized by its victory, while the BNP is angry and aggrieved. A key signpost to watch will be the BNP’s next move. Will it lay low, or try to mount resistance? With many of its leaders and supporters now in jail, it may initially opt for the former option. But it has showed in the recent past that crackdowns haven’t eliminated its mobilization capacities.Another key signpost is Hasina’s next move. If she were to make concessions—such as ordering the release of some jailed BNP leaders—that could reduce tensions, even if only modestly. But she appears in no mood for reconciliation: On election day, she described the BNP as a terrorist organization (separately, the government has recently warned of a newly established and banned terror group called Jamaatul Ansar, but the threat doesn’t appear that serious). Hasina must be careful: If the BNP resumes street protests, perhaps to exploit growing public anger over economic stress (as it did in December 2022), Hasina may be tempted to crack down hard—and any resulting unrest, especially if serious and sustained, could deter donors and investors that Dhaka badly needs amid rising inflation, debt, and other economic stress.Another longstanding flashpoint, the India-Bangladesh border, appears to be under control, especially with warm bilateral ties enabling border security cooperation that has reduced threats on both sides. But it remains delicate, especially if Hasina’s close personal ties with Narendra Modi fan more anti-India sentiment among the Bangladesh public (parts of which have previously railed against Modi and his policies). Ironically, one of Hasina’s closest partnerships is also linked to a key, albeit presently under control, security challenge. It’s telling that within hours after the announcement of the election result, the ambassadors of India, China, and Russia issued formal congratulations to Hasina. This is reflective of a broader trend: In South Asia and the broader Global South, many countries will welcome her return. (Pakistan, for well-known historical reasons as well as its uneasiness about Hasina’s closeness to Modi, may be one of the only exceptions—but Islamabad was one of the first capitals to congratulate Hasina. Amid political and economic turmoil at home, the last thing Pakistan can afford to do is pick a fight with Dhaka).Bangladesh’s strong economic growth under Hasina offers new trade opportunities, as well as financial assistance—which Sri Lanka received during a dark economic hour in 2021. Hasina’s push for connectivity resonates with Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, all of whom are pursuing new infrastructure initiatives with Dhaka. More broadly, her country’s continued contributions to global peacekeeping missions, and her willingness to host hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees, have endeared her to many Global South governments.Hasina’s biggest foreign policy challenge will be the West. The countries that pressured Bangladesh the most about free and fair elections are its critical Western trade partners. The US is Bangladesh’s top export destination—for garments and everything else. Pre-election, Hasina proudly and publicly defied the pressure—due to considerations about a domestic political audience, but also her own longstanding grievances about US policy—going back to Washington’s support for Pakistan in the 1971 war.  However, she’ll need to be careful not to risk upsetting relations with Western trade partners—especially amid economic stress. There’s also the risk of the US, having seen its various pressure tactics for free and fair elections—issuing strong public messaging, cajoling different parties to work out their differences, imposing visa restrictions—fail to bear fruit, and resorting to harsher tactics that could hit Bangladesh hard. That includes trade sanctions. Ominously, the day after the election, a State Department statement asserted that the polls “were not free and fair.” However, the West may do Hasina a favor. It values its trade relations with Bangladesh, and it views the country—situated on the Indian Ocean in the heart of the Indo-Pacific—as a strategically significant state, especially with it becoming a battleground for great power completion. Washington made Bangladesh a test case for its values-based foreign policy, but post-election it may let interests-based considerations carry the day. The State Department statement suggested as much, noting that the US “remains committed to partnering with Bangladesh.” Hasina faces other foreign policy challenges, too. Relations with South Asia could experience some bumps if other regional states, uneasy about India’s disproportionate clout in the region, grow wary of her attachment to Modi—and if Bangladesh’s ongoing economic problems diminish prospects for trade and connectivity cooperation.Another challenge for Hasina will be minimizing the risks of growing instability in the Middle East to key interests back home. Aside from friendly relations with most Arab states and longstanding membership in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Dhaka has little diplomatic heft in the Middle East. But, like India and Pakistan, Bangladesh relies heavily on remittances and energy supplies from the region. At a moment of economic struggle and power shortages, their importance looms especially large. These are all weighty matters. But in order to give them the time and attention they deserve, Hasina will first need to ensure that the political powder keg back home doesn't spin out of control—especially with the looming threat of worsening economic stress.(Michael Kugelman is director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, DC. This is an opinion piece.

https://www.thequint.com/opinion/bangladesh-election-new-lease-of-life-for-sheikh-hasina-awami-league-bnp,Bangladesh Election: A New Lease of Life for Sheikh Hasina and the Awami League,"As the results of the 12th general election emerged overnight after an eight-hour ballot exercise in over 42,000 voting centres across Bangladesh, the country’s four-time prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, must have been casually waiting to take up the same job for the next five years.The election results, for a 119 million voters in a country of 170 million, were seen as a fait accompli.With the country’s main opposition party — Begum Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) — choosing not to participate in what it dubbed a 'dummy election', everyone knew that the result was a foregone conclusion. And that is what happened. The ruling Awami League (AL) emerged victorious.Official results and gazettes are unlikely to come out until later in the day on Monday, but the unofficial results released by the Election Commission show that the AL bagged 223 out of 299 seats in the Jatiya Sangsad (Bangladesh's parliament). Voting for one of the seats was withheld due to the death of a candidate.The Jatiya Party of late autocrat General H M Ershad, known for its dubious double role of being a coalition partner of the AL and also a pet opposition, appears to be the biggest loser of the contest, with its seats reduced to less than half, that is, only 11 seats. Though the AL gave a 'walkover' to the Jatiya Party by not fielding its own candidates in as many as 26 constituencies, the other AL leaders who chose to contest as independent candidates gave the Jatiya Party nominees a hard time.The AL's efforts to pit their own as independent candidates against official party nominees paid off in terms of voter turnout. What many feared would be a very low number, the election eventually managed to have least 40 per cent (according to official numbers) of voters coming out.But the several 'King's parties' that fielded hundreds of candidates in 300 constituencies, understandably with the blessings of the party in power, did not manage to secure a single seat.Given that 60 per cent of eligible voters did not cast their votes on Sunday, the BNP claims that it succeeded in its call to the people to boycott. The BNP and its allies wouldn’t accept the new government and vowed to continue the movement for holding a fresh election under a neutral, non-partisan, caretaker government.Of the 12 national elections that Bangladesh had had since 1973, four were held under a non-partisan caretaker administration, that is, in 1991, 1996, 2001 and 2008; and those were arguably the best ones in terms of electoral neutrality and fairness.After the questionable elections held under the AL government in 2014 and 2018, with lots of allegations around rigging, the BNP and its allies made fervent calls and staged protracted street agitations seeking a caretaker government to administer the 2024 elections but the AL didn’t budge .Though there isn’t much question over the fairness of yesterday's election, it will go a long way in the country’s history of noninclusive, non-participatory elections. The new lease of life that the AL gained out of this election will inevitably lead to more rifts in Bangladesh's perennial political divide.For now, Sheikh Hasina, the world's longest-serving female head of state, is all set to take oath as prime minister of a country she has already ruled for a good 20 years.(Reaz Ahmad is the Executive Editor of the Dhaka Tribune.

Voter apathy is also evident since it is a foregone conclusion that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League (AL) party will return to power. The major Opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), has decided to boycott the election because its demand that the Hasina government resign and hand over power to a neutral government to conduct the elections, has been rejected.There is no Constitutional provision for a caretaker-neutral government anymore after the Supreme Court, in 2011, held that this provision was illegal, though the court left an option for the government to continue with it for a few more elections. The Hasina government opted to legislate the 15th Constitutional amendment to expunge this provision.While election campaigning may be in full swing with rallies, posters, and banners all over the country, the anticipation and excitement of an election result are missing. The BNP’s continuing agitation which disrupted normal life has now reached the final stage wherein it has called upon voters to boycott the polling. Violence has been unleashed and the latest attack has been on a passenger train which was set on fire, claiming the lives of four.The political scenario has been further complicated by the sentencing of 83-year-old Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus to 6 months in jail for violating labour laws. Hasina’s detractors have called the verdict ""politically motivated”.Her ire against Yunus dates back to 2007 when the Army-backed caretaker government attempted the so-called ""minus-two” formula which attempted to eliminate Hasina and Khaleda Zia, both former PM and popularly known as the ""battling begums”.Yunus was the first choice of the Army-backed caretaker government to create a new political party that would eliminate the two squabbling leaders. Hasina took Yunus’ political foray as a stab in the back by a person whom she had helped to build the Grameen Phone network. Yunus was granted bail immediately after the verdict was announced and the appeal against the sentence will certainly be heard by the High Court.Several legal cases were instituted against Yunus and his word famous microcredit organisation ""Grameen Bank” and mobile phone company ""Grameen Phone”. These cases attracted global attention since Yunus had pioneered the concept of microcredit to the needy rural folk who were outside the formal banking system. The drumbeat of criticism against Hasina, led by the US-led West, has been active for quite some time. The popular refrain being accusing Bangladesh of becoming a one-party state and democracy being suffocated. Domestic constituencies, many nurtured by the West and the Opposition parties, have rallied to this cause. Be that as it may, the US with its weaponising sanctions and Visa regime against officers of the anti-terrorist force Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and those who subvert the process of a free and fair election, has not succeeded in making Hasina bend to its will. She is not a leader who takes kindly to such blatant pressure.The US Ambassador in Dhaka had become overactive meeting opposition party leaders, anti-AL NGOs, and the Election Commission, attracting criticism of interfering in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation. The AL has no competition now and no incentive for fiddling with the election process. US' pressure persuaded India, China, and Russia to oppose external interference in Bangladesh. While China and Russia feel that it seeks to force Bangladesh to join its Indo-Pacific strategy and therefore, oppose the US, India regards external interference as detrimental to its strategic interest.It is no secret that the Pak Army delivers on numerous demands made by the US Administration and buys immunity on various domestic issues. The China factor also comes into play. Big powers routinely craft their policy depending on their specific interest. The US uses human rights and democracy selectively as leverage where it suits its interests.It is true that the Hasina government has cracked down on the Opposition and many thousands have been jailed. Her strong action has been justified time and again on the grounds of maintaining law and order because of BNP’s frequent attempts to force lockdowns, hartals, and running battles with the police causing death and injuries to many. But the BNP's chief reason remains that under Hasina, the possibility of a free and fair election remains a distant dream. It is speculated that BNP’s Vice-Chairman Tarique Rahman who is in forced exile in London, is behind the boycott decision. He cannot return to Bangladesh because of a series of convictions in corruption cases and a death sentence for being part of the conspiracy in the 2004 grenade attack on Hasina’s public rally which led to her injury and the death of several AL leaders. Many believe that Tarique is worried that if the BNP participates in an election, his control over the party will erode. Many allege that he has put his ambition above the interest of his party and his country.Ties with India have led to a booming trade and a slew of connectivity projects. Energy supplies from India and power projects being constructed by Indian companies will ensure energy security. India has also contributed to Bangladesh’s food and energy security, apart from extending around USD 10 billion in development assistance. Bangladeshis constitute the largest group of foreign visitors to India. Post-Covid and disruption in supply chains have caused a downturn in the economy. The Hasina government has had to approach the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a loan to buffer its falling foreign reserves. Inflation has fuelled price rise affecting the poor.The rising tide of Islamism in Bangladesh has undermined the secular fabric of the country since the late 1970s. Islamist parties have entered into alliances with the AL or the BNP for electoral gains because on their own, they do not have enough traction for winning. A new Liberal Islamic Alliance (LIA) has been formed which intends to participate in the election. The AL would be keen to facilitate the participation of such new parties to show that the election has been free and fair. The Islamist parties want more political command and aim to take over as the main opposition, displacing the BNP.These may each have a different political outlook but they all share the ultimate goal of making Bangladesh a Sharia-compliant Islamic nation. If that happens then, India’s neighbourhood challenges will multiply.(The author is a former Secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs; he has served as Deputy High Commissioner and later as High Commissioner to Bangladesh; he is a founding Director of DeepStrat, a think tank and a Visiting Fellow at the Observer Research Foundation.

https://www.thequint.com/opinion/bangladesh-election-why-the-outcome-matters-to-india-security-sheikh-hasina-china-us,Bangladesh Election: Why the Outcome Matters to India's Security ,"Earlier this week, two Harkat-ul-Jihad Islami (HuJI) operatives from Bangladesh were sentenced to death for their role in a bomb explosion on the Shramjeevi Express in July 2005. Four other men had been sentenced to life imprisonment on the same case earlier. The explosion in a train in eastern Uttar Pradesh had killed 14 people and wounded over 60.This is an urgent reminder to us that the elections in Bangladesh on Sunday are not only about the future of its democracy or economic plight. It is about security as well, but not just its own.Bangladesh, a country of 170 million, is almost completely surrounded by India and has borders with Mizoram, Tripura, Meghalaya, Assam, and West Bengal. In the past, and especially when the country has been ruled by military dictators or the Bangladesh National Party (BNP), separatists and insurgents from India found safe haven. It also provided a spring board for Islamists, both domestic and foreign, for operations in India.When India looks at Bangladesh, it cannot ignore the fact that during the rule of Sheikh Hasina between 1996- 2001 and then since 2009, it has received cooperation from Bangladeshi security agencies, and efforts have been made to curb anti-India activity in the country. Behind a lot of the anti-India activity had been the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency which had a free run during the rule of Begun Khaleda Zia’s BNP which was backed by the Jamaat-e-Islami. The HuJI also carried out a series of bomb blasts in Gorakhpur, Lucknow, Faizabad, and Varanasi, and supported the so-called Indian Mujahideen’s bombing campaign in 2008.The scale of the danger posed to India was evident in 2007 when the Border Security Force (BSF) gave their Bangladeshi counterparts a list of 112 separatist rebels from the north-east who were regularly using the latter as a sanctuary. In addition, they provided the Bangladeshis a list of 172 camps run by these separatist groups.The Islamists, particularly the HuJI, which is ideologically linked to Al Qaeda, has been responsible for a series of terror strikes within Bangladesh as well. In 2000 and again in 2014, they were involved in plots to assassinate Sheikh Hasina. In 2004, HuJI chief Mufti Abdul Hannan led a terror attack on a British envoy. The diplomat escaped, but three policemen were killed.Violence is a feature of Bangladeshi politics, and within this, Islamist violence is a category in itself. Besides the HuJI, there is the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen, Bangladesh (JMB) which triggered a series of 459 coordinated bomb blasts across in 63 of 64 districts within a 30 minute period in 2005. The JMB has also operated in India and were responsible for an attack in Bodh Gaya in January 2016 to coincide with the visit of the Dalai Lama.Perhaps the most spectacular terror attack carried out by the JMB in recent times was on the Holey Artisan Bakery in 2016 which killed 22 civilians, two police officers, and five terrorists. Among those killed were nine Italian, seven Japanese, and one Indian national.The Islamist challenge in Bangladesh is not the only thing that affects Indian security. After all, the country’s location is such that other issues such as its relations with third countries like China, Pakistan, or the US also affect us.Pakistan, with its support to terrorists and separatists, is now a has-been. The US has backed Bangladesh’s counter-terror agenda by providing training and resources. The US is concerned about the erosion of democracy in Bangladesh, something that bothers India less.China, on the other hand, poses significant challenges. Between 2016-2022, Beijing emerged as the largest FDI provider to Bangladesh, having provided some $26 billion worth of investments. Chinese loans have enabled Bangladesh to undertake significant infrastructure schemes such as the bridge over the Padma river and the Karnaphuli under the river tunnel. China is involved in the construction a dozen highways, 21 bridges, and 27 power plants in the country and its companies plan to have stakes in the new economic zones that Dhaka wants to establish. China is now Bangladesh’s largest trading partner with a trade volume of some $25 billion. Beijing has permitted a duty free regime for 98 per cent of Bangladeshi products like vegetables, frozen and live fish, leather, textiles, paper yard and woven fabrics, garments, and apparel items.The real security challenge from the current election is the fact that it will virtually be an uncontested one since the main Opposition party, the BNP, is boycotting it, saying that the ruling Awami League has used its repressive machinery to manipulate its outcome. Instability arising out of the ruling party’s tactics could have consequences.Once seen as a basket case, Bangladesh is today the world’s second largest garments exporter and has done generally well in terms of its economy. However, since last year, the country has been roiled by economic issues arising from inflation, fuel shortages, and a decline of its foreign exchange reserves that has forced the country to go to the IMF (International Monetary Fund). Continuing protests by garment workers have topped the ever-so-fragile political environment in the country of protests both violent and civil. This has intensified the anti-incumbency environment but with the BNP sitting it out, Sheikh Hasina will be re-elected. What happens after that will be another story.(The writer is a Distinguished Fellow, Observer Research Foundation, New Delhi.

Polling booths were also set on fire in the country, where general elections are to be held on Sunday, 7 January, Reuters reported.The latest: The suspected arson attack took place on the Dhaka-bound Benapole Express on Friday night, 5 January, sources told The Quint.Seven firefighting units helped bring the train fire under control in under one hour, as per Reuters.""Investigation is underway, but it seems the train was deliberately set on fire,"" railway police official Ferdous Ahmed was quoted as saying.Why it matters: The suspected train attack comes in the lead-up to the general elections in Bangladesh. The BNP had urged voters to boycott the polls and called for a two-day strike in the country from Saturday, 6 January.  The Opposition party has called for a United Nations-supervised probe into the fire, alleging that it was a ""pre-planned act of sabotage by government functionaries aimed at discrediting the non-violent movement of the BNP,"" AFP reported.The news agency quoted the police as saying that senior BNP official Nabiullah Nabi and six other members of the party were arrested on Saturday in connection with the case.Some context: The BNP had also boycotted the previous general elections in Bangladesh, alleging that the polls were rigged. The Opposition party had demanded that a neutral authority should conduct the elections. In response, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina (belonging to the Awami League) had accused the BNP of being behind the anti-government protests that had turned violent and led to the deaths of 10 people in October 2023.Anything else?

https://www.thequint.com/news/world/bangladesh-elections-2024-sheikh-hasina-explained,Bangladesh Elections: The Major Issues at Play – and What's at Stake for India,"""Sheikh Hasina is a complex character: She emerged from her father’s shadow wanting to develop Bangladesh’s democracy, but now she is slowly dismantling it,"" Michael Kugelman, Director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington DC, told The Quint. Hasina, the longest-serving premier of Bangladesh, is facing perhaps the greatest challenge to her democratic credentials in her over 40-year-long political career. It was in April 1991 when Bangladesh was struck by a devastating cyclone. Hasina was in the Opposition but was among the first leaders to reach the impacted areas near Chittagong – even before the ruling BNP could come up with a response to the tragedy.Visuals showing her walking amid the devastation and catering to those in need portrayed her as a woman of and for the people. The air of simplicity that contributed to her reputation and sustained itself over the years, and public sympathy emanating out of several attacks against her, saw Hasina achieve her first term in office in 1996.That was then.In the run-up to the 2024 elections, Hasina's party has been charged with authoritarianism in the form of rigging and coming down heavily on different forms of dissent. Furthermore, Zia – Hasina's main opponent – is ailing and under house arrest after being charged in two corruption cases.""It’s hard for any election to be considered credible if the main opposition isn’t participating. In this case, the concerns about a non-credible election extend to the factors that prompted the BNP to sit it out. These include, in particular, harsh crackdowns that left most top leaders in jail,"" Kugelman told The Quint.To lend an air of legitimacy to the election, the Awami League has reportedly asked several candidates to run as independent contenders – or as critics say, 'dummy' candidates – to make it look like a level-playing field.The one relatively strong party contesting against the Awami League is the centre-right Jatiya Party (Ershad).For this, it has been making several provisions – many of them allegedly undue. For instance, there are allegations against the ruling party that it has been threatening to strip people of the state's social benefits if they do not cast their ballots. (According to Bangladesh's Finance Ministry data, around 13 million people belonging to the lowest rungs of society are direct beneficiaries of the government's welfare schemes.)Put simply, the Awami League is doing everything in its power to ensure that its 76-year-old leader secures a credible fourth consecutive and fifth overall term as prime minister.It is no secret that the Narendra Modi government wants Hasina in control of Bangladesh's reigns. The Ministry of External Affairs also refused to comment on the Bangladesh elections, saying that the latter's domestic affairs are none of New Delhi's business.Ever since her first term in 1996, Hasina has forged close ties with India and has consistently maintained her stance over the years. India has also been supportive of greater bonhomie with successive Hasina governments, leading to the BNP accusing New Delhi of bias.""It shouldn't surprise one if India prefers Hasina as a preferable partner to work with,"" ORF Associate Fellow and South Asia expert Aditya Shivamurthy told The Quint. ""Her administration has shown a robust need to promote connectivity and infrastructure, limited cross-border terrorism, and mastered the art of balancing in which India does not necessarily have to be antagonised.""India fears that the return of the BNP and its partner the Jamaat-e-Islami could create a safe harbour for hardliners and separatist forces like the United Liberation Front of Asom, as it happened when the coalition assumed power between 2001 and 2006.However, this does not imply that the relationship is on perfectly sure footing. One of the major thorns in the ties is the influx of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants into West Bengal and Assam, and the BJP's response to it. In 2019, the then BJP chief Amit Shah had referred to illegal Bangladeshi immigrants as ""termites"", leading to backlash from several Awami League leaders.The alleged maltreatment of Muslims by right-wing groups in India also has a counter effect in Bangladesh, where anger is vented out against Hindus – which comprise a meagre 8 percent of the country's population. ""Hasina’s return will cement a strengthening India-Bangladesh relationship, but her return could also pose a few challenges for bilateral ties,"" Kugelman told The Quint. Of late, China is emerging as an important partner of Dhaka, having bankrolled a slew of infrastructure projects in the country. Hence, Hasina will have to walk a tightrope between both India and China – neither of which she can afford to alienate. You can read more on that here:Another major player in the politics of South Asia is the United States, which has made no qualms about its disaffection over the alleged 'undemocratic' processes espoused by the Awami League ahead of the election.In May last year, the US had announced visa restrictions on people attempting to disrupt the Bangladeshi general elections. Several western countries have further called for imposing sanctions against Bangladesh over alleged human rights violations and extra-judicial killings. However, India may be able to reign in the US from acting too harshly if and when a Hasina government retains power. This is because a dressing-down from the US may push Dhaka deeper into China's camp – something neither India nor the US can let happen.Furthermore, economic considerations may themselves deter the US from acting too harshly against Bangladesh. Given that the US is the top destination for all Bangladeshi exports, slapping sanctions could hit the country hard – especially amid worsening inflation and debt, according to Kugelman. Finally, the economic problems facing Bangladesh are here to stay – at least for now. This is not to take away from the fact that progress has been made across economic parameters during Hasina's rule. Industrialisation, development projects, girls' education, and electricity generation have taken centre stage in the Awami League's campaign for reelection.However, all is not as well as it seems. For instance, the implications of the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are still far from over.The country faced one of its largest labour protests in October last year, when the workers of its ready-made garment (RMG) sector demanded the tripling of minimum wages from 8,000 Bangladeshi Taka.The government has also failed to control the price hike of essential commodities and vegetables – which have the most devastating impact on the poorest families in Bangladesh. Amid the economic burden, several children were reportedly forced to drop out of school and child marriages saw an uptick, the Dhaka-based New Age newspaper reported.""Hasina stakes her claim as a successful leader on Bangladesh’s economic growth story, but she neglects looming economic problems like refusing to better diversify an export portfolio dominated by garments and textiles.
