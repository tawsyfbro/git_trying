A thick layer of toxic haze has enveloped the national capital once again, forcing the two teams to cancel their training at least once as Air Quality Index (AQI) remains in the severe category. While Sri Lanka decided to stay indoors on Saturday, Bangladesh braved hazardous conditions to train last evening, wearing masks at the Feroz Shah Kotla. The ”Tigers” had cancelled their opening training session on Friday due to poor quality air.    Also Read   CWC 2023: Kohli’s ton, Jadeja’s five wickets help India thrash South Africa by 243 runs    The AQI is above 400-mark on a scale of 500 since Thursday and according to the Air Quality Early Warning System, it is likely to remain ”severe” till Tuesday. On Sunday morning, the AQI stood at 457 according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The International Cricket Council (ICC) has made it clear that a call on future of the match will be taken only on game day when the match officials assess the air quality on Monday. Article 2.8 of ICC’s playing conditions, says “If at any time the umpires together agree that the conditions of ground, weather or light, or any other circumstances are dangerous or unreasonable, they shall immediately suspend play, or not allow play to start or to recommence.” “The decision as to whether conditions are so bad as to warrant such action is one for the umpires alone to make, following consultation with the ICC Match Referee.” Both the teams are no strangers to such a situation with the Sri Lankan players resorting to masks during a Test series back in 2017 and Bangladesh cricketers doing the same in a T20 in 2019. A number of Sri Lankan players had faced respiratory issues back then, while some even vomited in the dressing room due to the hazardous conditions. Bangladesh are already out of reckoning, while Sri Lanka’s semifinal hopes are hanging by a thread, depending more on mathematics and luck than performance. Ranked ninth out of 10 teams, Bangladesh are playing for pride, while Sri Lanka are little better placed at seventh in the standings and will look to hold on to the position to qualify for the 2025 Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Sri Lanka have an overwhelming 42-9 record against Bangladesh in 53 ODIs but the Tigers had defeated the Islanders in the warm-up game ahead of the World Cup and will take inspiration from that win. Sri Lanka are coming into the match after facing a nightmare against Indian pacers, who bundled them out for 55 during a 302-run thrashing and Kusal Mendis and his men will have to pick themselves up quickly against an equally hurt Tigers. While injuries have been an issue, Lankan players have also faltered against high-quality opponents and Bangladesh will have to produce a superlative performance to exploit their weakness. Sadeera Samarawickrama has been the find of the tournament for the Lankans, who have been served well by Pathum Nissanka and skipper Kusal Mendis in their batting from time to time though they lacked consistency. In bowling too, Lankan pacers have blown hot and cold, while lack of key spinners have hurt the team. For Bangladesh, it has been a forgettable outing as they have managed just one win against Afghanistan in the tournament. A chaotic build-up and lack of form of their players have seen them succumbing to their sixth successive loss and become the first team to be eliminated from the World Cup following a defeat to Pakistan in their last game. Their batters have not been able to build partnerships, while the bowlers too have failed to stop the run flow or take wickets, leaving even skipper Shakib Al Hasan bereft of any answers.

Netherlands caused another upset in the tournament, demolishing Bangladesh for 142 runs in 42.2 over after setting them a victory target of 230.    Also Read   Rohit Sharma back in top 10, Gill stays at second place in latest ICC rankings “Virat Kohli is probably best batter in modern era”: Shakib Al Hasan    Bangladesh, following their fifth consecutive defeat in six matches, are effectively out of the tournament as they have just two points. “We have been poor with the bat all tournament and this is as bad as it gets. There is more cricket to come and we have to pick ourselves up and I know it’s hard but we have to try to finish the tournament on a high,” said Shakib, who himself contributed just five runs here on Saturday. “Throughout the tournament, we have been struggling, I don’t know what’s on the players’ minds,” he added. The veteran all-rounder was also unhappy with the fielding effort, saying his players were “sloppy”. “I thought we bowled really well but we were sloppy in the field. We should have restricted them to 160-170 from the position we were in.” Netherlands’ hero of the day Paul van Meekeren said his team still has the determination to go all the way to the semifinals after causing another upset of the World Cup. The Dutch had defeated South Africa earlier in the tournament. Pace bowler Van Meekeren’s superb figures of 4 for 23 aided by Bas de Leede’s equally potent bowling (2/25) decimated Bangladesh. Van Meekeren said the victory was special. “Pretty special. We said we wanted to go for the semis, you need to win games. Very happy with how we bounced back after Australia (loss). We were pretty confident (today),” said van Meekeren. “At the halfway mark of our innings we thought 230-240 (would be a challenging total] and we got there. Aryan Dutt and Logan van Beek kept it very tight in the first 10 overs,” said van Meekeren. On the crisp fielding efforts by his players, he said it was because the team does a 20-minute drill before every game. “Every training we come in and do 20 minutes of fielding. Bassy (Bas de Leede) got a good throw at the stumps tonight. Hard to pick an individual performance. Pure team performance,” he said. This is the first time Netherlands have won twice at the same World Cup, courtesy their aggressive and disciplined bowling effort. Dutch skipper Scott Edwards said his bowlers had put in a superb effort. “I was sort of speaking to a couple of guys and we thought that if we could get somewhere around 220-plus, we would have a chance. They (bowlers) have all been brilliant.” On Netherlands’ strong showing in this World Cup, he said the “system” to play the game in the country was improving. “Probably a bit of everything. The system has been getting better in Netherlands. We have had a good 18 months. We feel like we are putting the work in and we are getting some of those rewards. We spoke at the start of the tournament about giving us a chance at the semis and that looks tricky but that’ll remain our goal.” Kolkata:A demoralised Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan slammed his players following their 87-run defeat against the Netherlands in the World Cup, saying it doesn’t get any worse and adding that he wasn’t able to figure out what was going on in their minds.Netherlands caused another upset in the tournament, demolishing Bangladesh for 142 runs in 42.2 over after setting them a victory target of 230.Bangladesh, following their fifth consecutive defeat in six matches, are effectively out of the tournament as they have just two points.“We have been poor with the bat all tournament and this is as bad as it gets.

https://telanganatoday.com/cwc-2023-bangladesh-aim-to-revive-campaign-against-dutch,CWC 2023: Bangladesh aim to revive campaign against Dutch,"Kolkata: Seeking a revival of fortunes, Bangladesh and Netherlands will have one last chance to keep their slender semifinals hopes alive when they clash with each other as the World Cup finally arrives at the hallowed Eden Gardens here on Saturday. As the sports-crazy city awakens from its 10-day Durga Puja revelry, the World Cup finally arrives in Kolkata, 23 days and 27 matches into the global showpiece. The familiar buzz and the World Cup excitement is, however, missing from the venue that is all decked-up for its leg of five matches which include the marquee India-South Africa clash and the second semifinal.    Also Read   CWC 2023: Virat Kohli’s ton help India beat Bangladesh by 7 wickets    Both teams have one win from four outings. Call it their misfortune or lack of a proper planning, Bangladesh’s campaign has fallen miserably after they began on a positive note with a comprehensive win over Afghanistan. Bangladesh had to face three heavyweights in defending champions England, last edition’s runners-up New Zealand and hosts India and the Bangla Tigers failed to spring any magic to see their World Cup campaign almost done and dusted. They were next drawn against South Africa, who were not pre-tournament favourites but the way the Proteas have taken the tournament by storm the Shakib Al Hasan-led side did not have any Plan B for a course-correction. Fresh from posting 399 in their previous game, South Africa batting was on fire yet again at the cost of Bangladesh who endured a 149-run rout. The team’s atmosphere was shaken so much that skipper Shakib had to fly back home in the middle of a global tournament for a few hours with his childhood mentor Nazmul Abedeen Fahim to sort out some “technical issues”. In such a scenario, it remains to be seen if the premier Bangladeshi all-rounder is able to revive their fortunes at his IPL home ground. Shakib has struggled with the bat at this World Cup, having scored just 56 runs in four innings, while he has taken six wickets. Both batting and bowling have been Bangladesh’s letdowns as they have failed to make much inroads. The biggest disappointment has been their No. 3 batter Najmul Hossain Shanto as the southpaw has copped four single-digit scores in their last four games which include two golden ducks. Coming on the back of a successful Asia Cup and breakout debut season, Towhid Hridoy too has failed to live up to the expectation and managed just 68 runs in three innings. However, their biggest positive has been senior batter Mahmudullah’s form who scored the first World Cup century for the team in this edition with a majestic 111 after being sidelined by the selectors earlier. With Litton Das also among runs hitting two fifties, Bangladesh will look up the duo to revive their campaign on a batting-friendly Eden wicket where dew could aid the team chasing. In bowling too, they would hope the four-pronged pace attack of Taskin Ahmed, Shoriful Islam, Hasan Mahmud and Mustafizur Rahman fire in unison. It has been a not so memorable campaign for the bottom-placed Netherlands barring the upset win over South Africa at Dharamsala. Since then, they have succumbed to losses against Sri Lanka and the resurgent Australia in their last two matches. Chasing a mammoth 400, the Dutchmen folded for 90 to concede a record 309-run defeat to Australia. It remains to be seen how their batters cope against the wounded Bangla Tigers who will hope to revive their campaign in the Puja carnival atmosphere here.

The team’s atmosphere was shaken so much that skipper Shakib had to fly back home in the middle of a global tournament for a few hours with his childhood mentor Nazmul Abedeen Fahim to sort out some “technical issues”.In such a scenario, it remains to be seen if the premier Bangladeshi all-rounder is able to revive their fortunes at his IPL home ground. Shakib has struggled with the bat at this World Cup, having scored just 56 runs in four innings, while he has taken six wickets.Both batting and bowling have been Bangladesh’s letdowns as they have failed to make much inroads. The biggest disappointment has been their No. 3 batter Najmul Hossain Shanto as the southpaw has copped four single-digit scores in their last four games which include two golden ducks.Coming on the back of a successful Asia Cup and breakout debut season, Towhid Hridoy too has failed to live up to the expectation and managed just 68 runs in three innings.However, their biggest positive has been senior batter Mahmudullah’s form who scored the first World Cup century for the team in this edition with a majestic 111 after being sidelined by the selectors earlier.With Litton Das also among runs hitting two fifties, Bangladesh will look up the duo to revive their campaign on a batting-friendly Eden wicket where dew could aid the team chasing. In bowling too, they would hope the four-pronged pace attack of Taskin Ahmed, Shoriful Islam, Hasan Mahmud and Mustafizur Rahman fire in unison.It has been a not so memorable campaign for the bottom-placed Netherlands barring the upset win over South Africa at Dharamsala. Since then, they have succumbed to losses against Sri Lanka and the resurgent Australia in their last two matches.Chasing a mammoth 400, the Dutchmen folded for 90 to concede a record 309-run defeat to Australia. It remains to be seen how their batters cope against the wounded Bangla Tigers who will hope to revive their campaign in the Puja carnival atmosphere here.","Both teams have one win from four outings.

https://telanganatoday.com/cwc-2023-de-kock-powers-south-africa-to-massive-win-over-bangladesh,CWC 2023: De Kock powers South Africa to massive win over Bangladesh,"Mumbai: ‘Run machine’ Quinton de Kock racked up his third century in five innings as South Africa extended their belligerent run in the World Cup with a 149-run win over Bangladesh here on Tuesday. Having piled up the third highest total of 382/5 in this World Cup — the first two also belonging to the rampant Proteas — South Africa ran through a largely disappointing Bangladesh batting effort, dismissing their opponents for 233 in 46.4 overs.    Also Read   “I had no choice but to go after bowling”: David Miller after playing 34-run knock against Bangladesh    Mahmudullah Riyad struck a valiant 111 off as many balls — his fourth ton in 225 ODIs and first in six years — but the other Bangladesh batters cut a sorry figure on a pitch that remained conducive for batting. It was Bangladesh’s fourth consecutive loss in the World Cup while South Africa now have four wins from five games. The defeat was also Bangladesh’s third heaviest in terms of runs in World Cup history. Bangladesh were cautious to begin with but twin strikes from Marco Jansen (2/39) in the seventh over to get Tanzid Hasan (12) and Najmul Hossain Shanto (0) caught behind, and in the next, Lizaad Williams (2/56) dismissing Shakib Al Hasan (1), broke their back. Litton Das (12) was pinned leg-before by Kagiso Rabada (2/) while the dependable Mushfiqur Rahim (8) was taken out by Gerald Coetzee (3/62). Mehidy Hasan Miraz (11), sent in at No 7 in the ever-changing Bangladesh batting line-up, was removed by Keshav Maharaj (1/32). There was no coming back from the hole Bangladesh had fallen into but Mahmudullah’s ton did help them reduce the defeat margin to a great extent. Mahmudullah added 41 runs for the seventh wicket with Nasum Ahmed (19), 37 runs for the eighth wicket with Hasan Mahmud (15) and 68 runs for the ninth wicket with Mustafzur Rahman (11) to keep South Africa out on the park for as long as he could. More importantly, Mahmudulla’s effort also averted the heaviest loss in World Cup history which was at the horizon at one stage when Bangladesh were reduced to 81 for six chasing 383. Earlier, de Kock’s magnificent 174 and a brutal 49-ball 90 from Heinrich Klaasen underlined South Africa’s batting prowess as they ended with a mammoth total. De Kock pumped 15 fours and seven sixes to not only record his third century in five innings, but his 140-ball knock which witnessed a fantastic late acceleration, also had the opener record the ninth highest individual score in the tournament’s history. Even though he was not required to do the heavy lifting after a stunning ton against England, a two-day break had Klaasen back at his best — cracking eight huge sixes and two fours — for his quickfire effort. In his 150th ODI, de Kock flayed the Bangladesh bowlers in hot and humid conditions to bat almost through the end, but certainly missed an opportunity to become the first South African to record an ODI double ton. En route his 20th ODI ton, de Kock went past India’s Virat Kohli for most runs and also eclipsed Australia’s David Warner (163) to record the highest individual score in this World Cup. And as has been the case a few times in the recent past, South Africa went ballistic in the last 10 overs to add another 144 runs with David Miller making an unbeaten 15-ball 34. Aiden Markram batted fluently for his 67-ball 60, using his hands adroitly to produce seven boundaries but an inside-out lofted hit found Das at long on in the 31st over off Shakib, with the third wicket stand producing 131 runs. The fourth-wicket stand was even bigger and better — 142 runs off just 87 balls between de Kock and Klaasen — as Bangladesh were left with a mountain to climb.

Also Read   Opinion: Many costs of simultaneous elections    The US barb is clearly aimed at the Awami League as opposition parties in Dhaka are pressing for a caretaker government before Bangladesh goes to poll in early 2024 as, in their opinion, ‘no free and fair election is possible with Sheikh Hasina in the Prime Minister’s chair’. Case Apart The issue is enough to raise eyebrows in international circles. True, the US has imposed similar visa restrictions on Sierra Leone also. But Bangladesh is a case apart. Geopolitically, it is much more important than Sierra Leone. Is the US trying to teach Bangladesh a lesson because of the latter’s growing proximity to China? After all, the political authorities of Bangladesh have been reported in the media to be admitting that their country’s relations with China are economic while Dhaka’s relations with New Delhi are almost umbilical. So the admission is there. This is enough to infuriate the US as it is now at loggerheads with China over its Indo-Pacific policy. Hasina Wazed, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, has thrown down the gauntlet by directly criticising the US over the latter’s Bangladesh policy. Impact on India But how does it hold a serious connotation for India? Well, the reason lies in the sudden growth of some Islamic fundamentalist organisations which aim to topple the Hasina-led government which is still India’s best bet in Bangladesh. Although Hasina has also compromised with Islamic fundamentalist organisations during her rule, she is still perceived in New Delhi as a bulwark against fundamentalist Islam in Bangladesh. But how complex is the situation in Bangladesh? The Awami League government is no doubt a bit nervous about the US stand. In order to contain Islamic fundamentalism, it has in fact compromised with it on several counts and as general elections in Bangladesh are only four months away, fundamentalist forces are trying to regroup there again. But in spite of the efforts of the Sheikh Hasina-led government to come to a mutual understanding with groups of Islamic militant forces, ominous shadows are hovering. A new militant outfit named Jamatul Ansar Fil Hindal Sharqiya (JAFHS) has come into existence incorporating members of the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), Ansar ul Islam (AAI) and Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami, Bangladesh (HUJI-B). The JAFHS, seven of whose members were arrested last October, is now perhaps working as an umbrella organisation of several militant outfits. Of its constituents, the AAI and the HUJI-B have connections with Al-Qaeda and ISIS respectively. Hefazat-e-Islam But the Bangladesh government must be watching with bated breath the plans and programmes of the Hefazat-e-Islam, the qaumi madrassa-based Islamic militant organisation which can perhaps boast of the largest number of membership among organisations of its genre. Over the years, Hasina has tried to placate this organisation in various ways without much success. The reason was clear — Hasina wanted to use the Hefazat against the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its alliance partner, the Jamaat-e-Islami. But pandering to Hefazat’s demand by the Awami League has helped the fundamentalist lobby instead. Hefazat wanted punishment for secular activists, inferior status of women in society and even control over governance and judiciary. Hasina gave it more than what it wanted. Secular activists and bloggers were arrested for pursuing ‘anti-Islamic activities’. In 2017, as demanded by the Hefazat, 17 stories and poems written by secular and non-Muslim writers were removed from Bangladesh textbooks. On top of it, the statue of Lady Justice was removed from the Bangladesh Supreme Court compound following objections from Hefazat. Moreover, the Sheikh Hasina government did pass a Bill bestowing equality of status on academic degrees given by a Hefazat-controlled madrassa with that of a secular university. There is a buzz in Bangladesh political circles that Hefazat has weakened and the Awami League has been able to gobble it up. Nothing is further from the truth. Hefazat indulged in widespread violent protests during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bangladesh in March 2021 on the occasion of the country’s 50 years of independence. Violence continued even after Modi’s departure and ultimately resulted in the deaths of 11 persons. Ideologically, all the militant outfits are closer to the BNP and the Jamaat-e-Islami than the Awami League. A phase of new groups and regroupings among the fundamentalists is going on. There is a possibility that the BNP and the Jamaat may boycott the poll if their demand for a caretaker government is not accepted. If the other fundamentalist groups join them and bring about widespread public anarchy, and there is a distinct possibility in this regard, then the situation will be really dicey not only for Sheikh Hasina but for India too.

The National Ulema Mashaikh Parishad (NUMP) in Bangladesh has organized a protest rally at the North Gate of Baitul Mukarram National Mosque on Sunday, meanwhile a demonstration was brought out under the banner of Sachetan Nagrik Samaj in Narayanganj.    Also Read   3 arrested as police bust spurious cough syrup factory in Meghalaya West Bengal: BSF foils arms smuggling attempt at International Border    Over 300 protestors were seen participating in the protest in Naranyanganj. They were carrying banners and placards highlighting the situation of Uyghyr Muslims. Moreover, NUMP Chairman Belayet Hossain Al-Firozi, Secretary Mufti Asadullah Zakir, and Advocate Khairul Ahsan were also present at the protest, according to Dhaka Tribune. Additionally, they have urged the Muslim community of the world as well as other global powers to raise their voices against Chinese atrocities in Uyghur. Earlier, the United States had strongly criticised China for imposing a life sentence on Rahile Dawut, a prominent Uyghur academic. Dawut, aged 57, had lost her appeal against her initial conviction dating back to December 2018, on charges of “endangering state security.” Human rights activists have alleged that China is conducting a large-scale internment campaign targeting Uyghurs, accompanied by disturbing practices such as forced sterilisation and cultural repression. Some government bodies, including the US State Department, have gone so far as to label these actions as “genocide.” China, however, denies these allegations, Dhaka Tribune reported. Matthew Miller, a spokesperson for the US State Department, issued a statement, stating that Dawut and other Uyghur intellects were ‘unjustly imprisoned’ for their work to protect and preserve Uyghur culture and traditions. It’s worth noting that Dawut is just one among a list of over 300 Uyghur intellectuals who have been detained, arrested, or imprisoned by Chinese authorities since 2016, as reported by the U.S.-based Dui Hua Foundation. Dhaka: Amid the world’s criticism of the atrocities done to Uyghurs, Dhaka and Narayanganj has witnessed protest rallies, demanding justice for Uyghur Muslims in China’s Xinjiang province, reported Dhaka Tribune.The National Ulema Mashaikh Parishad (NUMP) in Bangladesh has organized a protest rally at the North Gate of Baitul Mukarram National Mosque on Sunday, meanwhile a demonstration was brought out under the banner of Sachetan Nagrik Samaj in Narayanganj.Over 300 protestors were seen participating in the protest in Naranyanganj. They were carrying banners and placards highlighting the situation of Uyghyr Muslims. Moreover, NUMP Chairman Belayet Hossain Al-Firozi, Secretary Mufti Asadullah Zakir, and Advocate Khairul Ahsan were also present at the protest, according to Dhaka Tribune.Additionally, they have urged the Muslim community of the world as well as other global powers to raise their voices against Chinese atrocities in Uyghur.Earlier, the United States had strongly criticised China for imposing a life sentence on Rahile Dawut, a prominent Uyghur academic.Dawut, aged 57, had lost her appeal against her initial conviction dating back to December 2018, on charges of “endangering state security.”Human rights activists have alleged that China is conducting a large-scale internment campaign targeting Uyghurs, accompanied by disturbing practices such as forced sterilisation and cultural repression. Some government bodies, including the US State Department, have gone so far as to label these actions as “genocide.” China, however, denies these allegations, Dhaka Tribune reported.Matthew Miller, a spokesperson for the US State Department, issued a statement, stating that Dawut and other Uyghur intellects were ‘unjustly imprisoned’ for their work to protect and preserve Uyghur culture and traditions.It’s worth noting that Dawut is just one among a list of over 300 Uyghur intellectuals who have been detained, arrested, or imprisoned by Chinese authorities since 2016, as reported by the U.S.-based Dui Hua Foundation.","Amid the world's criticism of the atrocities done to Uyghurs, Dhaka and Narayanganj has witnessed protest rallies",None,None,None,ANI,bangladesh,2023-10-02 09:26:00,2023-10-02 09:56:00

The 34-year old cricketer met the Prime Minister at her residence with his wife, his former captain Mashrafe Mortaza and BCB president Nazmul Hassan and later briefed the media about his decision.      “Today afternoon, the Prime Minister invited me to her house. She admonished me and asked me to play again, so I have decided to come out of retirement at this moment,” Tamim was quoted as saying by Cricbuzz. “I can say no to everyone but it was impossible for me to say no to someone of the PM’s authority. Papon (Nazmul Hasan) bhai, Mashrafe (Mortaza) bhai were big, big factors too. Mashrafe bhai called me here and Papon bhai was also here. The Prime Minister also gave me a one and a half month break for my treatment and other things. After becoming mentally free, I will play the rest of the matches,” he added. Earlier, in an emotional press conference on Thursday, Tamim had made a shocking retirement announcement. The decision came a day after he had captained Bangladesh in the first ODI against Afghanistan. Tamim’s retirement had come as a surprise months before the 2023 World Cup in India but incidentally came on the heels of his public face-off with the management. The BCB president in particular, was critical of Tamim admitting in a press conference that he wasn’t fully fit for the opening ODI against Afghanistan but will still play. Once Tamim announced that he’s played his last international game, Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) called an emergency meeting and appointed Litton Das as the interim captain for the remaining two ODIs against Afghanistan. Nazmul, addressing the media late in the night, also publicly asked Tamim to take back his “emotional” and “hasty” decision. “I assumed that he took the decision emotionally. Of course it’s a big relief. If we don’t have a captain, how can we play?” BCB President Nazmul told the media after Tamim’s statement outside the PM’s residence. “I knew that if I could sit with him and talk, I could convince him. Today we were called on by the Prime Minister. Tamim said he would withdraw his retirement letter. But he has taken one and a half months leave to regain his physical and mental fitness,” he added.

According to media reports from Bangladesh, the deal was struck with Adani Power under the 2011 Indo-Bangla Framework Agreement for Cooperation on August 11, 2015, interestingly, just about two months after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s maiden visit to Bangladesh.    Also Read   Forbes identifies Vinod Adani’s unreported transactions involving offshore funds Adani issue: SC refuses to accept Centre’s sealed cover suggestion    A report in the Daily Star, which is now being shared widely with Adani’s business dealing coming under global scrutiny, says nothing explains the-then Bangladesh government’s rationale for signing the power purchase agreement for the deal two years later, with legal and energy experts finding the deal to be ‘exceptionally expensive’ and ‘overtly favouring’ Adani Power. “The way I would put it is heads Adani wins, tails you lose. The contract is so biased against the interests of Bangladesh to the point that one has to wonder why any sensible person would sign it on behalf of the Bangladeshi government,” Tim Buckley, an energy economist and founder of Sydney-based Climate Energy Finance Australasia, is quoted as saying. The report points out that there is virtually no scope for BPDB to get out of the contract for power purchase from the plant, which was built at an estimated cost of Rs.14,816 crore on ‘unconditional and irrevocable’ sovereign guarantee from the Bangladesh government that it would purchase the entire power generated for 25 years. Read the full story from The Daily Star here: Adani power purchase against ‘public policy’: How could such a deal be signed? “It is a punishable offence to sign such a contract — we believe that our agencies have the ability to identify the corruption in this deal,” the report quoted authorities of the Consumers Association of Bangladesh, while Bangladesh Nationalist Party Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir termed the power deal “unnecessary and uneven” and said Bangladesh would be unable to reap benefits from the project. Meanwhile, other reports indicated that the BPDB had communicated with Adani Power earlier this month, asking for a revision of the PPA. International current affairs magazine for the Asia-Pacific region, The Diplomat, in a recent report said that under the PPA, Bangladesh would have pay $450 million annually for 25 years as capacity and maintenance charges, even if it does not take any electricity from Adani Power Ltd. If Bangladesh wants to use electricity from Adani, it would have to pay an additional amount for coal, the report said, adding that the agreement provides for price fixing of coal by combining Indonesian and Australian coal prices. Thus, each ton of Adani’s coal would cost Bangladesh around $400, which was 60 percent higher than the usual price of coal, according to BPDB. “It is the Adani Group that comes out as the beneficiary of the deal. Adani’s coal would travel on Adani ships to reach an Adani-owned seaport, and from there an Adani-built railway would haul the coal to Adani’s Godda Power Plant. Finally, the generated electricity would be transmitted from Godda to Bangladesh via Adani-built high-voltage lines,” it said, adding that the PPA passed all associated costs of coal, including shipping and transmission, to Bangladesh, which made Adani’s electricity over five times more expensive that the market price of bulk electricity in Bangladesh. It also says that this was a purchase that Bangladesh did not need in the first place, because Bangladesh’s power-generating capacity exceeded its peak demand by over 40 percent. The PPA is also now being sharply criticized in Bangladesh, with Transparency International Bangladesh terming the contract “unequal, opaque, and discriminatory.” Hyderabad: A deal signed by Adani Power Limited, part of the Adani Group, with the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) in November 2017, is now under the scanner, with even the BPDB calling for a revision of the deal.According to media reports from Bangladesh, the deal was struck with Adani Power under the 2011 Indo-Bangla Framework Agreement for Cooperation on August 11, 2015, interestingly, just about two months after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s maiden visit to Bangladesh.A report in the Daily Star, which is now being shared widely with Adani’s business dealing coming under global scrutiny, says nothing explains the-then Bangladesh government’s rationale for signing the power purchase agreement for the deal two years later, with legal and energy experts finding the deal to be ‘exceptionally expensive’ and ‘overtly favouring’ Adani Power.“The way I would put it is heads Adani wins, tails you lose.

https://telanganatoday.com/india-bangladesh-to-secure-chickens-neck-with-rail-service-after-55-years,"India, Bangladesh to secure ‘chicken’s neck’ with rail service after 55 years","New Delhi: In a decision that will have huge geopolitical implications, India and Bangladesh have decided to resume trans-border railway connectivity between Haldibari in West Bengal and Chilahati located across the border in Nilphamari district after almost 55 years. The move will not only boost India-Bangladesh ties but will also open up connectivity for New Delhi with the north-eastern part and other bordering countries while reducing emerging vulnerabilities, especially at a time when an aggressive China is making steady inroads in the region through its much hyped Belt and Road Initiative.      Until 1965, when the India-Pakistan war took place, trains used to ply on this route. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina are expected to inaugurate this route on December 16, which is observed as the Vijay Diwas marking Dhaka’s victory over Pakistani armed forces, the reports said. The rail service is expected to resume from March 26, Bangladesh’s Independence Day. Haldibari, in Cooch Behar is strategically located. It is just 75 kilometres away from the critical Siliguri Corridor marking the 22 kilometre “Chicken Neck” that connects the rest of India with the north eastern states and other countries including Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan. “The rail service will be very important for India as it will provide the much required access to New Delhi to the north-eastern part and other neighbouring countries,” a foreign policy expert, on condition of anonymity told IndiaNarrative. “The area is of strategic importance to India as it the gateway to the northeast and the eastern part of India. The area especially around Nath-La Pass and even Doklam has seen several conflicts and now with an aggressive and increasingly belligerent China, India needs to protect this region. In case any other external force manages to break this corridor, India’s connectivity with the north east will be cut off,” the analyst said, adding that the new rail route will also boost trade between the two neighbours. Besides, there has also been demand from people from both sides to resume the rail service. Many Bangladeshis visit the region every year. While many of them come for trade and healthcare reasons, there is a large number of tourists as well. In the initial stage though, the Haldibari-Chilahati rail service could be restricted for cargo purpose. At present, India is connected with Bangladesh through four border links — Petrapole-Benapole, Singhabad-Rohanpur, Gede-Darshana and Radhikapur-Birol besides having one trans-border passenger train service, the Maitree Express. The Maitree Express connects Kolkata with Dhakaand Khulna. India is also looking at fast-tracking the Bangladesh-Bhutan-India Nepal (BBIN) initiative which will boost connectivity among the South Asian neighbours through rail and road. “The BBIN project is important for the region and we will expedite it. Bhutan will play an important role and through this the country will get access to ports. The project is beneficial to all member countries which are closely linked to each other for trade and other economic co-operation. We are keen to give it shape since it will increase regional connectivity and increase trade and not because of other any external factors or countries,”Gopal Krishna Agarwal, BJP’s spokesperson on economic affairs said. New Delhi: In a decision that will have huge geopolitical implications, India and Bangladesh have decided to resume trans-border railway connectivity between Haldibari in West Bengal and Chilahati located across the border in Nilphamari district after almost 55 years.The move will not only boost India-Bangladesh ties but will also open up connectivity for New Delhi with the north-eastern part and other bordering countries while reducing emerging vulnerabilities, especially at a time when an aggressive China is making steady inroads in the region through its much hyped Belt and Road Initiative.Until 1965, when the India-Pakistan war took place, trains used to ply on this route. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina are expected to inaugurate this route on December 16, which is observed as the Vijay Diwas marking Dhaka’s victory over Pakistani armed forces, the reports said. The rail service is expected to resume from March 26, Bangladesh’s Independence Day.Haldibari, in Cooch Behar is strategically located. It is just 75 kilometres away from the critical Siliguri Corridor marking the 22 kilometre “Chicken Neck” that connects the rest of India with the north eastern states and other countries including Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan.“The rail service will be very important for India as it will provide the much required access to New Delhi to the north-eastern part and other neighbouring countries,” a foreign policy expert, on condition of anonymity told IndiaNarrative.“The area is of strategic importance to India as it the gateway to the northeast and the eastern part of India. The area especially around Nath-La Pass and even Doklam has seen several conflicts and now with an aggressive and increasingly belligerent China, India needs to protect this region.
