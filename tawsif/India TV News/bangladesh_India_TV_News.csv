Asaduzzaman Khan was given charge of the Home Ministry while Dr Dipu Moni was shifted to the Ministry of Social Welfare.

The new council of ministers list named 14 new faces as full ministers and seven state ministers though some of them were elevated as cabinet ministers. Samanta Lal Sen, a doctor who specialized in burn wounds, emerged as a new face in the list of full ministers as a technocrat to the surprise of many as he was never known for political activism. Sen was given the charge of the health ministry. Several new names inducted in Bangladesh cabinet Simin Hossain Rimi, the daughter of the first prime minister of Bangladesh Tazuddin Ahmed, was named Minister of Women and Children Affairs. According to another Cabinet Division statement, under the Rules of Business the Prime Minister has terminated the appointment of two advisers, security affairs adviser Maj Gen (retd.) Tareq Siddiqui and private sector affairs adviser Salman Rahman. The premier also terminated the contract of ambassador at large Mohammad Ziauddin.

Fire service chief Brigadier General Mohammad Main Uddin, meanwhile, said two of the dead were minor children. “When we tried to bring out a middle-aged man through a window of the train but he asked me to leave him and rather save his wife and children from inside,” a local youth was seen telling the private Jamuna TV. He said soon fire engulfed the man's and he died shortly thereafter.A report by the Somoy TV said that some Indian nationals were also travelling in the train. While the railway officials could not immediately confirm how many people were wounded, private TV channels said that people in the neighbourhood first reached the scene and sent several fire-wounded people to Dhaka Medical College Hospital’s burn unit and some other facilities. Bangladesh goes to polls on Sunday The incident has taken place ahead of the national elections in Bangladesh. The country is set to vote on Sunday.More than 100 foreign observers, including three from India, have reached Dhaka to monitor the general election. Led by former prime minister Khalida Zia, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is boycotting the general election as it is demanding an interim non-party neutral government to hold the election. The demand was rejected by the government headed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is heading the ruling Awami League. Foreign Ministry officials said a three-member delegation from the Election Commission of India reached Dhaka on Friday while 122 others from different countries were set to be here ahead of the January 7 polls, which the United Nations said would watch closely.

Bangladesh seamers proved very hard to score off at McLean Park and right-arm off-spinner Mahedi Hasan impressed a lot. Mahedi bagged 2/14 in his four overs on a wicket that didn't have much in it for him and assisted his seamers incredibly well. Though Bangladesh were fairly disciplined in their bowling performance, their batters looked ordinary while chasing a below-par total of 135 runs. Barring Litton Das (42 off 36 balls), none of the other Bangladesh batters managed to stay long enough in the middle and that's a worrying sign for the visitors. On the other hand, the Kiwis are expected to come hard at the Najmul Hossain Shanto-led side in Mount Maunganui. The Blackcaps wield a lot of firepower in their batting order and it may prove a daunting task for the Bangladesh attack to keep the hosts quiet two games in a row. The pitch at the venue is usually abelter for batting and hence the batters are likely to have a field day. The wicketoffers true bounce and therefore shot-making becomes an easier task.

The economist was convicted for violating the labour laws. However, his supporters termed the development as ""politically motivated"" ahead of the general elections.   Yunus is known for his 'Grameen Bank' Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his anti-poverty campaign, earning Bangladesh the reputation of being the home of microcredit through his Grameen Bank, which he founded in 1983. The 83-year-old economist and three of his colleagues in Grameen Telecom-- one of the firms he founded-- were accused of violating labour laws when they failed to create a workers' welfare fund in the company. The Third Labour Court Judge Sheikh Merina Sultana ordered Yunus to serve six months of simple or non-rigorous imprisonment for violating the law as the Grameen Telecom chairman, along with three other executives of the social business company. ""The allegation of violating the Labour Law against him has been proved.It appears that the allegation has not been barred by limitation (either),"" the judge said, pronouncing the judgment while Yunus was in the dock. She also slapped a Taka 25,000 fine (USD 227.82) on each of them, adding that they would have to serve 10 more days in jail in case of a default.Soon after the judgment was passed, Yunus and the three other executives sought bail, which the judge granted immediately for a month in exchange for a Taka 5,000 bond. Under the law, all four can appeal against the verdict in the High Court.The verdict comes just days ahead of the January 7 general election in Bangladesh.His supporters have described the judgment as ""politically motivated"". Last month, after a court appearance for the hearing, Yunus rejected claims of profiting from Grameen Telecom or any of the more than 50 social business firms he founded in Bangladesh. ""They were not for my personal benefit,"" he told reporters. His lawyers called the case ""meritless, false and ill-motivated"" and claimed it was only aimed to harass and humiliate Yunus before the global community. The Nobel laureate is also facing a series of charges relating to labour law and misappropriation of money. The economist was on a protracted row with the incumbent government due to obscure reasons. The Sheikh Hasina-led administration began a series of investigations against him after coming to power in 2008. Bangladesh authorities began a review of the statutory Grameen Bank's activities in 2011 and fired Yunus as its founding managing director on charges of violating the government retirement regulations. Many people believe that Hasina became enraged when Yunus announced he would form a political party in 2007 when the country was run by a military-backed government, and she was in prison. However, Yunus did not follow through on the plan but criticised politicians in the country, alleging they were only interested in making money. Hasina's government began a review of the Grameen Bank's activities in 2011 and fired Yunus as its founding managing director on charges of violating government retirement regulations. He was put on trial in 2013 on charges of receiving money without government permission, including his Nobel Prize award and royalties from a book. Hasina called Yunus a “bloodsucker"" and accused him of using force and other means to recover loans from poor rural women as head of Grameen Bank. He was later granted bail after his court appearance. After his prolonged efforts to settle disputes with the government, Yunus blasted the government for paving the way for the “destruction” of the pioneering micro-lending bank he founded. In August 2023, 18 former Grameen Telecom workers filed a case against Yunus, accusing him of siphoning off their job benefits. Separately, Yunus went on trial in August 2022 on charges of violating labour laws. The economist and 13 others were also named in a case brought by the Anti-Corruption Commission accusing them of embezzling funds from Grameen Telecom.

Playing at McLean Park in Napier, Tanzim and Shoriful ran riot and demolished New Zealand's batting order up front to set up the nine-wicket victory for their side.   Having already lost the series, the Bangla Tigers took the field intending to salvage their pride. Nazmul Hossain Shanto got lucky with the coin flip and invited the hosts to put a score on the board. The decision bore fruit for the visitors as both Tanzim and Shoriful made the ball talk early on and never let any Kiwi batter feel comfortable in the middle. In-form batters, Will Young (26 off 43 deliveries) and skipper Tom Latham (21 off 34 balls) tried to display their magic with the willow once again but it wasn't to be and were removed by Shoriful. Apart from Young and Latham, Josh Clarkson (16 runs) and Adithya Ashok (10 runs) were the only ones to reach the double digits and New Zealand's struggle in the middle came to an end in the 32nd over of the innings with just 98 runs on the board. Soumya Sarkar played a crucial role in cleaning up the Kiwi tail as he bagged 3/18 in six overs and was the third bowler from Bangladesh to pick up a three-for in the game. Chasing just 99 to win the game and end their 18-ODI losing streak against the Kiwis in New Zealand, Bangladesh openers Sarkar and Anamul Haque Bijoy walked out to bat.

The development came amidst the political unrest over the January 7 elections. The attack coincided with the nationwide stoppage called by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) on Tuesday as part of its ongoing campaign to boycott the polls and launch a formal protest against the Election Commission's polls schedule.   The arson attack on the train was the fifth in the past month but the deadliest so far in terms of casualties. The miscreants set on fire three compartments of the Dhaka-bound inter-district Mohanganj Express early morning shortly after the train left the Airport Railway Station at the entry point of the capital, police and witnesses said. What Bangladeshi Police and witnesses say “The passengers saw the fire after the train left the Airport station, it was stopped at the next stop at Tejgaon station,” Tejgaon police station officer-in-charge Mohammad Mohsin said. At least four persons, including a woman and her child, have died after the train was set on fire amid a hartal called by the BNP. Mohsin said another minor boy was missing while his mother awaited in front of the gutted compartment as fire service rescuers were searching inside. Railway officials said the locomotive master halted the train at Tejgaon where the fire service rescuers doused the blaze and retrieved four bodies while two of the dead remained unidentified. Rail Minister accuses Opposition party Railway minister accused the country’s main opposition party of “arson” and “sabotage” after a fire broke out early Tuesday on a passenger train in the capital killing four people, including a mother and child. “Now, they have targeted a safe means of transport like a train,” said Nurul Islam Sujon, accusing the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, of resorting to violence and sabotage in the name of anti-government protests to thwart the national election slated for January 7 and “create chaos.” Political tensions on the rise ahead of Bangladesh Presidential elections Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s ruling Awami League has emerged as the prime contender in the absence of ailing ex-premier Khaleda Zia’s BNP which has boycotted the January 7 polls since its demands for a no-party caretaker government to organise the voting were not met. Awami League is contesting the polls against its technical Opposition in Parliament Jatiya Party and independent candidates, including the rebel contenders who fielded their candidature after failing to secure the party nomination. Awami League earlier said it would encourage the independent, including the party’s rebel candidates to make the polls participatory though voters have little option other than reelecting the ruling party for the fourth consecutive term since the December 2008 elections. Violence hit Bangladesh One passenger was killed last week and dozens wounded as saboteurs uprooted railway tracks on the same train on the same route last week when seven carriages derailed in Gazipur on the outskirts of the capital. Dozens of trucks, buses and private cars were torched since late October while the violence killed at least six persons. Hasina, meanwhile, said, ""They can't oust the government by killing people”. Bangladesh will deploy the Army for 13 days from December 29 to maintain order “in aid of civil power” ahead of the January 7 general elections amid the political unrest. However, the military called it a routine poll time duty. The Election Commission announced the polls schedule on November 15 amid continued political unrest. Bangladeshi opposition party demands interim govt BNP has repeatedly been saying no election under the ruling Awami League would be fair, demanding the government’s resignation to pave the way for an interim non-party neutral government for polls oversight. Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal earlier said despite the need for a “congenial atmosphere” for a smooth election, “for a long time there exist differences of opinions among political leaderships on the question of election, particularly over the institutional method of the polling”. In a veiled reference to BNP and its allies, Awal said his office invited all registered political parties who were “reluctant” to take part in the upcoming polls for dialogues with the Commission but “they rejected the invitation”. But he asked the nearly 110 million voters to freely exercise their rights franchise in an “enthusiastic atmosphere, discarding all worries, tensions and unease”. Election boycott BNP had boycotted the 2014 election but took part in 2018 polls, which party leaders later said was a mistake alleging that the voting was marred with widespread rigging and intimidation. According to media reports, over 10,000 opposition leaders and activists, including BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir have been arrested in a nationwide crackdown while BNP claimed the figure to be as high as 20,000. A Dhaka court on Monday denied a bail request from Alamgir, meaning he could not guide his party ahead of the election next month. He is the key party leader since the ailing Zia is hospitalised and faces 17 years of imprisonment following her conviction in two corruption cases that her party says were politically motivated.

The hosts are without their top players in the series but that didn't affect them much in the series opener at University Ground in Dunedin.   Blackcaps skipper Tom Latham led from the front in the first game with a splendid 92 off 77 balls with the help of nine fours and three sixes and scored at a strike rate of 119.48. Latham and Will Young attacked the Bangladesh spinners and swept them effectively around the park to neutralise them. One can expect them to go with the same approach at Nelson too. Bangladesh seamers will have to step up to the occasion in the 2nd ODI for the visitors to have any chance of making a potential comeback in the series. Notably, Latham was dropped in the slip cordon during the first ODI quite early in his innings and then made the Najmul Hossain Shanto-led side pay. The wicket seams around a bit early on and gives pacers enough opportunities up front to dent the batters. However, if the batting side successfully manages to negotiate the new-ball threat then it can make use of the short-sized ground dimensions and tonk the ball many a mile. Spinners won't get much help out of the surface and hence the Bangladeshi spinners will have to rely on deception in flight to create an impact.

Conveying his warmest wishes on Victory Day, Verma on Saturday said the Liberation War and the triumph of the people epitomise the two countries' shared sacrifices for Bangladesh's freedom and stand testimony to the time-tested friendship between Delhi and Dhaka. ""As nations whose destinies are as connected as our geographies and historical roots, we are today at the cusp of realising the promise of a Sonali adhyay (golden chapter) in our ties,"" he said. What happened in 1971? The Liberation War in 1971 broke after the sudden crackdown at midnight on March 25, 1971 in the erstwhile East Pakistan by the Pakistani troops and ended on December 16. The same year Pakistan conceded defeat and unconditionally surrendered in Dhaka to the allied forces comprising the freedom fighters and the Indian soldiers. Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Biman Bangladesh Airlines inaugural flight from Dhaka to Chennai at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport here, Verma said the level and scope of partnership and the engagement between Bangladesh and India has grown at a rapid pace in recent years and connectivity has been one of the major manifestations of this transformation in the relationship. In terms of air connectivity alone, he said, there are more than 120 flights linking Dhaka with five major Indian cities every week, besides a Delhi flight linking Chattogram with Kolkata. ""Whether for tourism, for business, for health care or education, our people-to-people connect is a thriving, living foundation of our bilateral relations,"" Verma said, adding that the number of people travelling to each other's country is only going to grow in the coming years. ""The new transport links which are being constantly added to enhance our cross-border linkages, and the rising number of our people travelling to each other's countries reflect a new era of our growing engagement and a new momentum in our people-to-people relations,"" he said. 15 lakh visas issued to Bangladeshi citizens During the last financial year, the envoy said, they issued over 15 lakh visas to Bangladeshi citizens visiting India, and the number is going to be surpassed this year. ""We do indeed want this number to grow because we believe that people-to-people relations are what makes our relationship special,"" he said.

Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Kazi Habibul Awal announced the schedule for the upcoming elections while addressing the nation. This came as the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) enforced a 48-hour blockade to pressure the Awami League government. This is the first time the polls have been announced in a televised speech. Earlier, a recorded version of the election schedule used to be announced by CECs. Security tightened in Bangladesh Ahead of the announcement, security was beefed up in the capital and other major cities as BNP and its far-right allies waged a street campaign demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government to allow a non-party interim government to conduct the general elections. The ruling Awami League has rejected the demand, saying elections would be held under the incumbent premier Hasina, who also rejected proposals for dialogue with the Opposition by the US and other major Western countries, going so far as to call the BNP a terrorist organisation. Police on Wednesday warned that any acts of arson or sabotage would be strictly dealt with, as the BNP began the fifth phase of their nationwide transport blockade to spearhead its campaign against the Hasina-led government. “We have taken all steps to ensure security,” Dhaka’s police commissioner Habibur Rahman told Bangladeshi media. Police and paramilitary forces were deployed outside the Election Commission building to ensure law and order. What is going on in Bangladesh? Chaos erupted in Bangladesh from October 28 when opposition parties took to the streets to demand Hasina's resignation and started enforcing transport blockades and clashing with police and activists to press their demands. The violence has continued for over two weeks, resulting in the deaths of five people, including a policeman. Over 200 people have been injured and dozens of vehicles have been set ablaze during the increasingly violent protests. Roughly 8,000 opposition leaders and activists including BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir have been arrested in a nationwide crackdown. While government leaders insisted that they were arrested for criminal activities, the BNP accused Awami League of turning the country into a ""big person"". Western countries call for political settlement Seven countries, including the United States, Britain and Canada, condemned the political violence in Bangladesh and urged all parties to exercise restraint and settlement between the three main parties. US Ambassador to Bangladesh Peter Haas on Monday sought meetings with leaders of the three parties to break the political impasse. ""The United States wants free and fair elections conducted in a peaceful manner and calls on all sides to eschew violence and exercise restraint,"" the embassy said. In 2014, the BNP and like-minded parties boycotted the 10th general election over similar demands. The Awami League was then elected for a second consecutive term amid violence across the country. In 2018, the BNP took part in the election but raised allegations of ballot stuffing.

The opposition has demanded PM Sheikh Hasina to resign and allow a non-partisan interim government to conduct the elections."

Supporters of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the ruling Awami League clashed a day after the BNP called for a nationwide strike against police action that forced the party to abruptly end its grand rally against PM Hasina on Saturday. The diplomatic missions of the seven countries - the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea and Norway - expressed concern at the violence, urging all parties to ""exercise restraint"" and ""eschew violence"", in a joint statement issued on Monday. The countries also called on all stakeholders in Bangladesh to ""create conditions for free, fair, participatory and peaceful elections"". They also extended their condolences for the loss of life and to those injured. What's happening in Bangladesh? At least four people were killed after BNP and Awami League supporters clashed during the nationwide strike, which heightened tensions ahead of Bangladesh's general elections in January 2024.At least 1,000 people were arrested — among them, Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, a key opposition figure from the BNP led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia. According to police, one activist of the BNP was killed after falling from an under-construction building in Dhaka’s Mohammadpur area when he tried to escape after setting a bus on fire. However, the BNP blamed Awami League activists. A senior journalist, Rafiq Bhuiyan, who suffered injuries during clashes between police and opposition activists in Dhaka’s Kakrail area on Saturday, succumbed to his injuries on Sunday. Several passenger buses were damaged or set on fire in the capital and elsewhere in the country throughout the day. On Saturday, the opposition BNP had organised a massive rally demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to allow free and fair elections under a non-party interim government. PM Hasina's party also held a peace rally in response to the Opposition rally. Clashes ensued on that day, leaving two dead, including a policeman, and over 200 injured. Several ambulances, other vehicles, including motorbikes, entering the frontal part of Rajarbagh Central Police Hospital and a police booth were burnt. At the end of the day-long strike, BNP called for a ""countrywide blockade"" on October 31, November 1 and 2 protesting the killing of the party activists and the arrests of party leaders and activists, including Alamgir. Paramilitary forces deployed Riot police overnight raided the BNP's central office while authorities called out paramilitary troops ahead of the countrywide strike. Paramilitary Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) deployed 11 platoons or over 300 troops to maintain public order in the capital. As per reports, police arrested at least 900 leaders and activists of BNP and its far-right ally Jamaat-e-Islami from across the country in the past 24 hours. Why is BNP agitating? Notably, Sheikh Hasina, the daughter of the country's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, has been in power for 15 years. On the other hand, the BNP has been mounting protests to press their demands for months, although their ailing leader, Khaleda Zia, a two-time PM, is currently under house arrest after a conviction on corruption charges. According to the BNP, it is their final attempt to remove Hasina as the election commission prepares to announce the country’s 12th national election. Both sides started their rallies in complete defiance of the conditions by crippling traffic movements. Khaleda Zia has served as Bangladesh PM two times and is currently being treated at a private hospital for severe chronic ailments. Her elder son Tarique Rahman has been declared a 'fugitive contact' with several criminal charges and has taken asylum in London. The European Union on Sunday said the EU and its member states in Dhaka were deeply saddened to see the loss of life and violence on the streets. Prior to that, Bangladesh’s independent Election Commission said it was yet to see a “favourable environment” for the scheduled January 2024 polls. (with PTI Inputs)",The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) organised a major rally demanding Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation ahead of the general elections in January. The ensuing unrest led to paramilitary forces being deployed in the capital.

The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) led by former prime minister Khaleda Zia organised a major rally in the capital, while the ruling Awami League also held a peace rally. Things turned for the worse when BNP activists set a police booth on fire and pelted stones at the chief justice's residence. They also damaged several vehicles, leading law enforcement personnel to retaliate with tear gas canisters and batons. Paramilitary Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) personnel were deployed to control the protesters. “BNP leaders and activists attacked the government installations and property, legal actions will be taken,” said Dhaka Metropolitan Police’s detective branch chief Harunur Rashid, adding that several policemen were injured and admitted to a hospital that also came under attack. However, this did little to stop the BNP, who again called for a nationwide strike on Sunday to protest against police action to stop their rally and 'assault' their activists. In the meantime, the Awami League mobilised thousands of supporters at the South Gate of Baitul Mokarram Nation Mosque in Dhaka. Police in riot gear with water cannons created buffer zones at the Purana Paltan area to prevent clashes among rival activists, who were armed with bamboo sticks and stones.

""He (Ebadot) will not be available for us in the World Cup.It's a big blow for us as he will require operation for his knee.

UN humanitarian coordinator in Yemen David Gressly said that five men which included four from Yemen and one from Bangladesh “went through a very difficult period of isolation”, however, they were in “good spirits and health”. The five staff members walked free after lengthy negotiations which also included officials from Oman, UN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said. Gressly, who spoke to UN reporters after flying with the four Yemenis to the country's southern port city of Aden, said: “I can confirm that the hostage-takers were Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.” The group is also known as AQAP and has been active in southern Yemen for years. It is considered one of the most dangerous branches of global Al-Qaeda network which has attempted to carry out attacks on the US mainland. “This is a threat that remains here in in Yemen — and remains actually an increasing threat,” Gressly said of Al-Qaeda. Suspected Al-Qaeda militants had abducted five UN staff members in February 2022 in southern Yamen’s Abyan province, officials said. UN statement In a statement earlier Friday, the UN's Haq named the freed men as Akm Sufiul Anam; Mazen Bawazir; Bakeel al-Mahdi; Mohammed al-Mulaiki; and Khaled Mokhtar Sheikh. All of them worked for the UN Department of Security and Safety. Sufiul Anam, a retired Bangladeshi lieutenant colonel who was the department's field coordinator, told a news conference after arriving at Dhaka airport Wednesday that he never thought he'd return home after a “horrifying” experience in Yemen's hills and desert at the hands of terrorists. “There was a fear of death every day; it cannot be expressed in words; it is seen in films only. I was blindfolded all the time. The terrorists changed my location 18 times and kept me at 10 places. Fortunately, they did not torture me,” Sufiul Anam said. Bangladesh's National Security Intelligence Director Imrul Mahmud said that the kidnappers had demanded USD 3 million in ransom, but they did not pay any money. Gressly said the United Nations never pays ransom, which is a reason why the UN staffers may have been held for so long.

Although Mysterious Team Bangladesh first emerged in 2020, it gained global recognition in 2022 due to its cyber campaigns targeting high-profile entities in India, Israel, and other nations. The group's activities underscore the often underestimated threat posed by hacktivism. Unlike ransomware actors who engage in negotiations, hacktivists aim to disrupt critical systems, potentially resulting in substantial financial and reputational losses for the targeted organizations. Religious and political motivations drive Mysterious Team Bangladesh's actions, as outlined in the Group-IB report. The group has extended its activities beyond India, also targeting countries such as Australia, Senegal, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Ethiopia. The group has managed to breach web servers and administrative panels, likely exploiting known security vulnerabilities or weak passwords.

Sandwiched between the WTC Final and the upcoming five-match Ashes, this game might not be of much importance in an ODI World Cup year. But being it only the 7th Test match for Afghanistan, it reminds that Test cricket should spread wider. Both Bangladesh and Afghanistan have faced each other only once, where the latter emerged victorious by 224 runs. Before the action unfolds, let's see how these two can have a crack at each other at the Shere Bangla National Stadium, Dhaka.   Bangladesh fret over injury issues; Afghanistan miss Rashid Khan Both Bangladesh and Afghanistan will miss key players but more so the home side as they have more injury issues. Regular Test captain Shakib Al Hasan is out due to finger injury, while, Tamim Iqbal has been ruled out owing to lower back pain. Moreover, Taskin Ahmed is unlikely to play due just recivering from a side-strain. Litton Das will don the captain's hat while uncapped player Shahadat Hossain can earn a cap after impressive show against West Indies A in May.  Afghganistan will also be without their ace spinner Rashid Khan, who is out to manage his workload. This could mean spinners Zahir Khan and Izharulhaq Naweed getting the nod along with Amir Hamza. Pitch and conditions The surface in Dhaka has been traditionally a pitch to assist spinners but there was some greenary on the 22-yards before the game. However, low bounce and less pace is expected in the match. There was rain before this game and the weather is not clean for this contest. There are intermittent showers expected to interrupt the game. Best batter Prediction: Ibrahim Zadran can be a batter to watch out for. He averages 44 after four Tests and has three fifties to his name, which also features an 87-run knock against Bangladesh. He also scored 98 in an ODI against Sri Lanka earlier in the month. Best bowler Prediction: Mehidy Hasan can be a bowler to watch out for. Depsite there being a tinge of greenary, the surface is expected to play slow and bounce low. It traditionally helps the spinners and Hasan has had his good time in Dhaka. He has taken 49 Test wickets at the venue and is 1 shy of registering 50 scalps. Match winner Prediction: Bangladesh","BAN vs AFG Test Today match prediction: Bangladesh will play in their second Test match of the year, whereas Afghanistan will complete for the first time in Tests after 2021. The two will meet in Dhaka for the one-off game."

The incident took place on Thursday (April 6) in Rowangchhari upazila in Bangladesh's south-eastern Bandarban District, which is a hotbed of insurgency. “Clashes and gunfire were witnessed in a remote corner of Roangchhari upazila (sub-district) of Bandarban on late Thursday. We have recovered eight bodies from the scene,” police officer Abdul Mannan said. Mannan said the bodies were brought to the upazila headquarters on Friday for autopsy and other legal formalities. Police said nearly 200 people fled their homes following the clashes, fearing violence among feuding groups, and took refuge at an army camp at Roangchhari. The reason for the clashes is not known. But police suspect the incident involved members of the newly-formed outfit called Kuki Chin Front (KNF), which is the break-away faction of the United People’s Democratic Front (UPDF). The UPDF is a regional political party based in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh. Chakmas form the majority ethnic group in the party. Formed in 1998, the group claims to seek a fully autonomous Hill Tracts through peaceful and democratic means. Security officials said the KNF emerged as an armed group dominated mostly by the Bom ethnic community and reportedly formed an alliance with an Islamist militant group in the hills. The KNF claims to be representing six of the 16 ethnic minority groups of Chittagong Hill Tracts. They are demanding a separate state be formed with several sub-districts of two of the three hill districts. “The KNF’s terrorist activities forced residents there to leave their abode and come to our (army) camp for temporary refuge. We have sheltered them and arranged their food with the help of civil administration,” Captain Fahim, an official of Bangladesh Army’s Bandarban Zone told journalists. Bangladesh’s security agencies said a manhunt was underway to track down and arrest Nathan Bome, the KNF chief. Meanwhile, authorities will maintain heightened security in the affected areas. In the event of further violence, they may enact movement-restrictive measures, such as imposing a curfew in the region, officials added.

Banerjee, who was addressing a public meeting at Ranaghat in Nadia district, said that if a resident of West Bengal's Nadia or North 24 Parganas districts, both bordering Bangladesh, has to prove his citizenship again, the same yardstick has to be applied for all, including the prime minister and Union home minister. ""Those who are misleading the people in the name of the Citizenship Amendment Act, I have one question for them. Why rules cannot be framed even after the CAA was tabled in Parliament. Because they used the CAA to get votes. ""If you have all documents and got benefits of the government's welfare schemes, and if you have voted in earlier polls, why there is a need to do it all over again? Because the BJP wants to divide the people,"" the TMC's Diamond Harbour MP said while addressing the gathering. The CAA facilitates the grant of citizenship to migrants belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. But as the rules under the Act have not been framed by the government yet, no one so far could be granted citizenship under it. ""In the name of the National Register of Citizens, the BJP had omitted the names of 19 lakh people from the NRC list. We won't allow them (BJP) to do the same in West Bengal,"" said Abhishek Banerjee, the nephew of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. His comment came weeks after Suvendu Adhikari, the leader of the opposition in the West Bengal Assembly, dared the CM to stop the implementation of the CAA in the state. After the landslide victory in the 2011 assembly polls and also in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, ""the TMC's performance in many parts of Nadia district is not satisfactory in the subsequent polls"", the party MP said. ""The results in Ranaghat were not up to expectations. We are here to take corrective action. If you are not happy with the work of people's representatives in three-tier panchayat bodies, you tell us why,"" Abhishek Banerjee told the gathering. He shared a toll-free number where people can send names of their favourite candidates for panchayat polls for a particular area. ""If anyone wants to work for TMC to serve his own interests, the door is open for him...If anyone is found to be involved in contract business directly or indirectly, he cannot hold any post,"" the TMC leader said, adding that the party will not tolerate any act of vote loot and booth jam during the 2023 panchayat elections. Banerjee publicly asked Partha Pratim Dey, the pradhan of Tatla-1 gram panchayat in the district, to send his resignation papers by Monday for allegedly ""not visiting the area after being elected four years back"". ""Mr Roy please send your resignation by Monday. We will have a new panchayat pradhan who will be more responsive to the needs of people. Those having acceptability among local residents will only get tickets. I am razing down the wall between you (voters) and the people you will elect,"" the TMC leader said at the public meeting. Banerjee also stated, ""Earlier, leaders from Kolkata used to come here and announced names of candidates (for rural polls) nominated by the party and then did not come back to the area in the subsequent six months to see how they were performing. Those days are over. The new TMC will correct the previous mistakes and be more transparent to make a new panchayat system for people."" Banerjee also accused the CPI(M) and the BJP of being involved in the murder of TMC workers in the district in the last five years.","Banerjee's comment came weeks after Suvendu Adhikari, the leader of the opposition in the West Bengal Assembly, dared the CM to stop the implementation of the CAA in the state.

The move to grant citizenship under the Citizenship Act, 1955, and not the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA) bears significance. Though the CAA also provides for granting Indian citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, and Christians coming from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, however, as the rules under the Act have not been framed by the government yet, no one so far could be granted citizenship under the said act. According to a notification by the Union Home Ministry, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, and Christians residing in the districts of Anand and Mehsana in Gujarat will be allowed registration as a citizen of India under section 5 or will be granted a certificate of naturalisation under section 6 of the Citizenship Act, 1955 and in accordance with the provisions of the Citizenship Rules, 2009. How will citizenship be granted? All such people will have to submit their applications online, which will then be verified by the collector at the district level. The application and reports thereon shall be simultaneously made accessible online to the central government, the notification read. The collector may make such inquiry as he considers necessary for ascertaining the suitability of the applicant and for that purpose, forward the application online to such agencies for verification and comments as may be required for completing such an inquiry, it said. After completing the entire process, the collector, being satisfied with the suitability of the applicant, will grant him or her citizenship of India by registration or naturalisation and will issue a certificate of registration or naturalisation, as the case may be, the notification said. The Citizenship Amendment Act In January 2020, the Home Ministry notified that the Citizenship Amendment Act would come into force from January 10, 2020, but it later requested the parliamentary committees in the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha to give it some more time to implement rules as the country was going through its worst ever health crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Last fortnight, the Union Home Ministry was granted yet another extension by the Parliamentary Committees on Subordinate Legislation in the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha to frame the rules of the CAA. While the permission has been granted from the Rajya Sabha till December 31, 2022, the Lok Sabha has granted time till January 9, 2023.

At least 140 million people were out of power Tuesday afternoon.   Officials of the state-run Bangladesh Power Development Board said that power transmission failed somewhere in the eastern part of the country. All power plants tripped and electricity was cut in the capital, Dhaka, and other big cities, said Shameem Hasan, a power department spokesman. Engineers were trying to determine where and why the glitches happened and it could take hours to restore the system, he said. Bangladesh’s recent impressive economic growth has been threatened by power shortages since the government suspended operations of all diesel-run power plants to reduce costs for imports as prices have soared. The diesel-run power plants produced about 6% of Bangladesh’s power generation, so their shutdowns cut output by up to 1500 megawatts. Earlier this month, Faruque Hassan, president of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that the situation is so serious that garment factories are without power now for around 4 to 10 hours a day.

In a bold statement, BCB chief Nazmul Hasan Papon said that Bangladesh are focussing on the next edition of the World Cup, not the upcoming one. The team will be led by Shakib Al Hasan, while they endured a tough time in the recently concluded Asia Cup T20. The side lost both of its matches in the group stage and faced elimination before the Super Four Stage. The selectors then didn't sit back and took a harsh decision by dropping the experienced Mahmudullah. After being sacked as the skipper in the Zimbabwe tour, Mahmudullah continued to feature in the team.

Owing to their loss against Sri Lanka, Bangladesh has now become the first team to crash out of the Asia Cup. In a virtual semi-final on September 9, 2022, Pakistan will lock horns against a much weaker Hong Kong side. The winner goes through to the super 4 stages, whereas the team which ends on the losing side will have to bid adieu to their Asia Cup campaign. Amidst all of this, it is safe to say that Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan too needs to be blamed for Bangladesh's elimination from the marquee-cricketing tournament. The Bangladesh captain has now committed the same mistake that was done by Rohit Sharma and Babar Azam earlier in the tournament.    Slow over rate rule by ICC: To minimize the practice of slow over rates, the ICC has a strict rule in place. Both team India and team Pakistan have been a victim of this in their recent clash on August 28, 2022. The rule clearly states that any given team will have to bowl their complete quota of 20 overs by the 85th minute and if they fail to meet this requirement, then the team will be allowed only to field 4 players outside of the 30-yard circle (the inner circle). In the match that Bangladesh played against Sri Lanka, the Shakib Al Hasan-led side was lagging by 2 overs. According to the law, Bangladesh was penalized and had to field 5 players in the inner circle, when combined with the bowler and the keeper, they become seven.

From this season onwards, India has extended the period of flood data transmission to Bangladesh up to October 31 to cater to any unforseen situation, the sources said.   The matter was recently discussed at a meeting of the Joint River Commission held with Bangladesh. The 38th meeting of the ministerial-level Joint Rivers Commission of India and Bangladesh was held in New Delhi on Thursday.

At the meeting, it was also decided that a standard operating procedure or protocol for flood data sharing shall be prepared by the technical committee and till such time, the existing mechanism will continue to operate. The meeting assumes significance as it was held after a gap of 12 years, though the technical interactions under the framework of the JRC have continued in the intervening period. The meeting was preceded by water resources secretary-level interactions on Tuesday. According to a statement issued by the Jal Shakti ministry, India and Bangladesh share 54 rivers, of which seven were identified earlier for developing a framework of water-sharing agreements on priority. During the meeting, it was agreed to widen this area of ongoing cooperation by including eight more rivers for data exchange. The matter will be further discussed at the technical-level committee of the JRC. India is providing a five-day advisory forecast based on the IMD rainfall forecast that is available in the public domain, which can be used by Bangladesh. The JRC and the ministerial-level meeting come ahead of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's three-day visit to India starting September 5, during which defence cooperation and regional stability are likely to be the focus of her talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, an official said.

He said government offices and banks will cut their workdays to seven hours from the previous eight hours, but that private office will be allowed to set their own schedules.

Last month, fuel prices were raised by more than 50%. The government says it is exploring options to get cheaper fuel from Russia under a special arrangement. The decision has drawn criticism, but the government said it is necessary to cut losses amid rising international fuel prices. Small street protests against the higher prices have taken place in recent weeks, and the government said domestic prices will be adjusted after international prices ease. The country has been suffering more frequent power cuts after the government suspended operations of all diesel-run power plants, reducing daily electricity production by 1,000 megawatts.

In one of the greatest tales of comebacks so far, Zimbabwe defeated Bangladesh for the first time since 2013.    Zimbabwe won the toss and opted to field first.

With 5 half centuries in the top order, Bangladesh breached the 300 landmarks and looked pretty set to win the game by a big margin.  Keeping up with their reputation, Zimbabwe lost both its openers in the first two overs and was reeling on 62/3, but a partnership between Innocent Kaia and Sikandar Raza, which included centuries by both batsmen enabled their team to win the first of three ODIs.

At one point I thought we were slightly behind the game, so all I was trying to focus on is to back him and tell him that if we stay here we win this game together, to try and calm him down and try and encourage him to play good cricketing shots"", said Raza.

The game was halted yet again in the eighth over and the match was reduced to 14 overs each. Bangladesh got only 13 overs when it poured again and interrupted the match again.

The situation is so bad that many people were forced to take refuge on their rooftops amid gushing rising waters until rescue boats came into Sunamganj. No official data was available on the death toll but unofficial reports suggest that the ongoing flood has killed at least 19 people in the country. The FFWC attributed the flooding to excessive rainfalls simultaneously in upstream Meghalaya and Bangladesh. The incessant downpours aggravated the miseries while the deluge severed the road links of northeastern Sunamganj district from the rest of the country and forced authorities to close a major international airport in neighbouring Sylhet after water submerged its runway. Flood water engulfed several power stations, forcing authorities to shut down the facilities, subsequently affecting internet and mobile phone communications. Earlier, Bangladesh called in the Army to aid the civil administration in evacuating people or reaching succours to marooned people while the Navy and the Air Force units subsequently joined them in the northern Sylhet region.","Nearly 90 per cent of homes in Sunamganj are now under water while in Sylhet the figure is estimated to be 80, according to TV channels"

They were both spinners, with left-armer Keshav Maharaj collecting 7-32 and offspinner Simon Harmer 3-21. They both cashed in on spin-friendly conditions on a wearing pitch to take South Africa home. It was a surprisingly sudden end to the match after Bangladesh had hopes of possibly pulling off its first test victory over South Africa by needing 274 runs in the final innings. But the tourists slumped to 11-3 at the close of play on Day 4 in Durban and the wickets continued to tumble dramatically on the morning of Day 5.

Bangladesh's total was its second-lowest in test cricket after the 43 it was bowled out for against West Indies in 2018. Its 53 was also the lowest test total ever at the Kingsmead ground in Durban. The huge winning margin belied a test which was competitive for much of the time. It might even have tipped slightly in Bangladesh's favour at one point on the fourth day when South Africa went from 116-1 to 204 all out in its second innings to give the touring team a sight at that historic test win over the Proteas. Bangladesh had already won its first one-day series in South Africa earlier in the tour. But its hopes in the first test were ripped away by Maharaj and Harmer, with Maharaj's seven at his home ground taking him to 141 career test wickets, now the most by a South African spinner since the country returned to international cricket after apartheid.

bangladesh,https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/gauhati-hc-asks-bangladeshi-immigrant-to-apply-for-citizenship-under-caa-2022-01-10-753760,Gauhati HC asks East Pakistan immigrant to apply for citizenship under CAA,"January 10, 2022, 10:40 PM",2022-01-10,10-1-2022,"Gauhati High Court has set aside the order of a Foreigner's Tribunal in Assam which had declared a person who had migrated from erstwhile East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) as a foreigner and asked him to apply for citizenship under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The order was passed in the judgment to a writ petition filed by Bablu Paul alias Sujit Paul of Karimganj district of Assam by a High Court Bench comprising Justices N Kotiswar Singh and Malasri Nandi.   The Foreigners' Tribunal-II of the district had in May 2017 declared Paul a foreigner who came to India illegally from Bangladesh on or after March 25, 1971. The High Court in its order said that Paul was about two years old when he entered India with his father Boloram Paul and grandfather Chintaharan Paul on September 30, 1964 from the then East Pakistan, which became Bangladesh on March 26, 1971. ""...They were given refugee status by the Government of India as (is) clearly evident from the certificate issued by the Government of West Bengal to the members of the minority community in East Pakistan desiring to stay in India,"" the order said. According to the petitioner, his grandfather had entered through West Bengal but thereafter settled in Assam and his name appeared in the voters' list of the state in 1966. He died later. The Tribunal also noted that the petitioner had studied up to class five in Gandhi Colony Madhyamik Vidyalaya in Kolkata and after attaining his majority was engaged in jewellery business at Jadavpur area of that city. ""... It is on record that the petitioner came to Patharkandi, Karimganj, Assam, only in the year 1984 and settled there and started his jewellery business,"" said the High Court judgement on December 14, 2021. The judges said that considering the evidence on record, there is no doubt that the petitioner had entered India in 1964 and thereafter stayed in Calcutta (now Kolkata) till 1984, then shifted to Assam and settled in the state. ""The question which naturally will arise is, what will be the status of the petitioner, who had entered India in the year 1964 from East Pakistan and continued to stay in India? Is he to be declared a foreigner?"" they wondered. The two-judge bench expressed its inability to declare Paul as an Indian citizen as claimed by him as he was not born in this country but in East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, and entered India in 1964. As to whether a person who enters India in 1964 from East Pakistan can be considered to be an Indian or not, there is no provision under the Citizenship Act, 1955 except for Sections 6A(2), the judges said. ""Under Section 6A(2) of the Citizenship Act, 1955, a person entering India before 01.01.1966 can be deemed to be a citizen provided he enters Assam from the specified territory (East Pakistan) and he has been ordinarily residing in Assam after the date of entry,"" the bench said. According to the Assam Accord, foreigners entering Assam on or before March 25, 1971 can get the benefit of citizenship if they register themselves before the competent authority. Those who entered the state after the date will be declared as foreigners. Also Read |BJP MPs from West Bengal meet PM Modi, demand implementation of CAA in state The High Court said that as the petitioner did not enter Assam but West Bengal and also as he has not been a resident of Assam after his date of entry in 1964, he cannot get the benefit of deemed citizenship under Section 6A(2) of the Citizenship Act, 1955. ""Under such circumstances, the question which arises is, whether the petitioner will be declared a foreigner, in which event, he will be liable to be deported also,"" it said. The bench then pointed to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA), which said any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered India on or before December 31, 2014 shall not be treated as an illegal migrant. Such immigrants are also exempted from the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920, the Foreigners Act, 1946 and any rule or order made thereunder, it added. ""Since the petitioner cannot be considered to be an illegal migrant by virtue of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 and since he had been staying in India for more than seven years from now having entered in 1964, in our view, he will be entitled to be considered for grant of citizenship by registration under Section 5 of the Citizenship Act, 1955,"" the HC said. The Gauhati High Court directed the petitioner to make an application for registration as citizen of India under Section 5 of the Citizenship Act, 1955 immediately before the competent authority. The competent authority on receipt of the application will pass appropriate orders regarding the citizenship of the petitioner. Till the consideration of the application, he will not be subjected to any coercive action by the state/authorities, the HC ordered.

The fire broke out around 3:00 am (local time) on Friday in the engine room of the Barguna-bound MV Abhijan-10 launch that started a journey from Dhaka, police and fire service officials said, adding that scores of other passengers were missing.Officials familiar with the rescue campaign said 40 people were killed in the blaze, including nine being drowned, but some private television channels, quoting officials, reported 41 deaths from the accident in southern Jhalakathi district, 250 kilometres from the capital Dhaka.""The rescue campaign is still underway, we can update you about the casualties later,"" a district administration official told reporters.The record suggests 310 listed passengers were travelling in the launch (ferry), but we assume the actual number was much higher,” junior minister for shipping Khaled Mahmud Chowdhury told reporters after he visited the accident site.He said three separate investigations have been launched to find out the background and other details of the predawn accident.Doctors at the Sher-e-Bangla Medical College Hospital in the neighbouring Barishal district said they were currently treating 70 people while fire service officials said some 50 more were being treated at other health facilities.Coastguard, fire service and police personnel are spearheading a search campaign covering rivers in three downstream districts. The accident took place at the confluence of rivers as a huge number people crowded on the river banks and hospitals to find their relatives.""Most of the people were burnt to death or died due to breathing problems due to hot smoke as they were trapped inside the vessel. Many passengers jumped into the river but some of them could not swim ashore or be rescued,” a fire service official said.Another fire service official earlier said many passengers were asleep as the fire broke out, some died from inhaling smoke, some were burnt to death while some drowned.Witnesses told reporters that the passenger ferry, called “launch” in Bangladesh, was carrying passengers beyond its capacity and most of them were visiting their homes to spend more time with their families on the extended weekend.Authorities ordered an investigation to determine the cause of the fire. A seven-member committee has been formed and tasked to submit a report in three days. Rescuers fear the death toll is likely to rise as more passengers have been injured in the pre-dawn fire.Many passengers jumped into the river in a desperate bid to save their lives as the fire raged for about three hours. Survivors say the launch was packed with passengers, bdnews24.com reported.Administrative chief of Barguna’s Patharghata sub-district Muhammad Hossainn Mohammad Al Mozahid was one of the passengers of the launch who was travelling in a VIP cabin with his wife.""Suddenly thick smoke started causing us breathing problem... Everybody was screaming and rushed to the exit gate and some jumped into the river,” he recounted.He said the master of the launch managed to manoeuvre the vessel to a nearby shoal where he along with many other passengers disembarked but “many remained trapped inside to await the death”.""The engine room of the launch suddenly caught fire around 3:00 am and spread rapidly when the vessel was near the Gabkhan Bridge,” Saidur Rahman, another survivor, was quoted as saying by the Daily Star newspaper.""There were many passengers including children and elderly. Many of them jumped in the river and were able to swim ashore,"" he said.“I caught a burning smell and came out of the VIP cabin to find out that there was a fire. Me, my wife and brother-in-law then jumped in the cold water and swam to the bank,” he added.The fire service control room in a statement said 15 firefighting units led by Barishal Fire Service deputy director Kamal Uddin Bhuiyan rushed to the scene after receiving the information at 3.50 am and brought the blaze under control at 5:20 am.Bhuiyan, deputy director of the Barishal Fire Service who led the response, said they suspect the fire may have started in the launch's engine room.""After receiving the information, 15 firefighting units led by Kamal Uddin Bhuiyan, deputy director of Barishal Division Fire Service and Civil Defence went to the scene at 3:50 am and brought the fire under control at 5:20 am,"" the statement said.The accident was the latest in a number of similar incidents in Bangladesh, a small country criss-crossed by a network of some 230 rivers of different sizes and shapes. These watercourses cover nearly 7 per cent of the total area of the country.An overloaded speedboat allegedly driven by an inexperienced underage boy capsized in Bangladesh after a collision with a sand laden vessel in May this year, killing at least 26 people.In June last year, a ferry carrying over 100 passengers capsized in the Buriganga river in Bangladesh after it was hit from behind by another ferry, killing at least 32 people. In February 2015, at least 78 people died when an overcrowded ship collided with a cargo vessel.","The fire broke out around 3:00 am (local time) on Friday in the engine room of the Barguna-bound MV Abhijan-10 launch that started a journey from Dhaka, police and fire service officials said, adding that scores of other passengers were missing."

The violence broke out in Cox’s Bazar district when one side opened fire, killing four people at the scene, said Shihab Kaiser Khan, commander of the Armed Police Battalion, which oversees the camp’s security. Two others died in a hospital while they were being treated for their injuries, Khan said. It was not immediately clear why the violence broke out, but local media said the two sides were feuding to establish supremacy in the camp over an illegal drug business. Bangladeshi officials said earlier that some Rohingya groups are involved in serious crimes such as kidnapping and ransom-seeking, and that they use the camps to smuggle drugs from Myanmar, where they lived before arriving in Bangladesh. Khan said one Rohingya man was detained with weapons but did not provide any further details. He said police were searching the camp for other suspects. Friday’s violence occurred about three weeks after an international representative for the Rohingya refugees was shot to death in the camp in the same sub-district of Ukhiya. Mohibullah, who was in his 40s, was a teacher who emerged as a key refugee leader and a spokesman representing the Muslim ethnic group in international meetings. He visited the White House in 2019 for a meeting on religious freedom with then-President Donald Trump and spoke about the suffering and persecution the Rohingya faced in Myanmar. Police have made several arrests related to his murder. More than 700,000 Rohingya have fled to refugee camps in Bangladesh since August 2017, when the military in Buddhist-majority Myanmar began a harsh crackdown on the Muslim ethnic group following an attack by insurgents. They joined hundreds of thousands of others who have fled to Bangladesh over decades. The 2017 crackdown included rapes, killings and the torching of thousands of homes, and was termed ethnic cleansing by global rights groups and the U.N. While Bangladesh and Myanmar have sought to arrange repatriations, the Rohingya are too fearful to return home. Overall, Bangladesh has been sheltering more than 1.1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar after previous waves of persecution.","The violence broke out in Cox’s Bazar district when one side opened fire, killing four people at the scene, saidShihabKaiser Khan, commander of the Armed Police Battalion, which oversees the camp’s security."

Opener Mohammad Naim struck a fine half-century to help Bangladesh set a 154-run target before bowlers led by star pacer Mustafizur Rahman (4/36) restricted Oman to 127/9. Both Oman and Bangladesh now have one win each, and will be vying for the only remaining spot to qualify for the Super 12 stage. Scotland, who beat Papua New Guinea earlier in the day, have already qualified from the group. While Oman will take on Scotland, Bangladesh will next face Papua New Guinea. Chasing a challenging target, Ludhiana-born Jatinder Singh (40 off 33) provided a solid start for Oman alongside Kashyap Prajapati (21) but the other batters struggled. Like Oman, Bangladesh were also guilty of dropping catches. But under tremendous pressure, they held their nerves and thanks to some astute captaincy by skipper Mahmudullah and the spinners Shakib Al Hasan and Mahedi Hasan they were able to make a strong comeback. Left-arm pacer Mustafizur Rahman took four wickets. Oman needed 54 runs in the last five overs. But with the boundaries drying up and the required run rate continuously increasing, Oman batters became desperate and went for the big shots, losing their wickets in the process. Shakib, who starred with the bat also pitched in with the ball, ending with impressive figures of 3/28 while Mahedi Hassan (1/14) and Mohammad Saifuddin (1/16) took a wicket each. Opting to bat in a must game win, Bangladesh, who lost their tournament opener to Scotland, struggled to 29 for the loss of two wickets in the powerplay. With their backs up against the wall, Naim, who hit 64 of 51 deliveries, and star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan (42 off 29) shared an 81-run stand to give their side the much-needed momentum. Dropped catches and sloppy fielding only added to the two batters' increasing confidence. While Fayyaz Butt, who played U-19 cricket for Pakistan, pulled off a stunning catch of his bowling to get rid of Mahedi Hasan for a duck, Oman were guilty of dropping as many as three catches. Naim, playing his first game of the tournament, hit four maximums and three boundaries while Shakib's innings was studded with six fours. However, a brilliant piece of fielding that saw Aqib Ilyas effect Shakib's run out that saw the spring return in Oman's step. The co-hosts seized the momentum, snaring six wickets while giving away 41 runs in the last five overs. Pacers Fayyaz Butt (3/30), Kaleemullah (2/30) and Bilal Khan (3/18) shared eight wickets while left-arm spinner Zeeshan Maqsood (1/17) accounted for one Brief Scores: Bangladesh:153 all out in 20 overs (Mohammad Naim 64, Shakib Al Hasan 42; Fayyaz Butt (3/30), Bilal Khan (3/18);Oman127/9 in 20 overs (Jatinder Singh 40; Mustafizur Rahman 4/36)",Oman vs Bangladesh T20 World Cup 2021: Bangladesh beat Oman by 26 runs to register their first win and stay alive in the T20 World Cup 2021.

Hindus and Buddhists in Bangladesh have become ""third class citizens"" and the growing anti-Hindu mindset is alarming, the writer said.   Bangladesh has been witnessing attacks on the Hindu minority community, vandalisation of temples and Durga puja marquees. Communal tension has been brewing over an alleged incident of blasphemy at a Durga Puja venue in Comilla last week that triggered clashes in many districts. Slamming the attacks, the writer told PTI in an interview that, ""I actually don't like to call it Bangladesh anymore. It has become 'jihadistan' now. All the subsequent governments including the present one used religion for political motives. They made Islam the state religion so Hindus and Buddhists have become third class citizens and subject to persecution like this."" Nasreen, who had to leave Bangladesh in 1994 in the wake of death threats by fundamentalist outfits for her alleged anti-Islamic views, said the anti-Hindu sentiment is not new in Bangladesh and it was strange that no protection was given to Hindus during Durga puja festival. ""Sheikh Hasina is very well aware that every year during Durga puja time, there is a chance of' jihadi' attack on Hindus. So why no protection was given to the Hindu minorities,"" the 'Lajja' fame author said. Fearing that many Hindus will leave the country now, she said if the government wanted to protect them, it could have done so. ""This growing anti-Hindu mindset is very alarming. There were 30 percent Hindus living there during the time of partition but now it is reduced to nine percent,"" said the 59-year-old Bangladeshi-Swedish writer. The author, whose book 'Lajja' is banned in Bangladesh, said, ""I wrote my novel Lajja' in 1993 in which a Hindu family is attacked by Muslim fanatics and decides to leave the country but it is not that such incidents happened only in 1993, it is continuously going on."" ""Hindus are tortured, persecuted and threatened by Muslims. It has been going on for years as Muslims want Hindus to leave the country so that they can grab their land,"" the author alleged. Lajja is considered the author's response to anti-Hindu riots that erupted in parts of Bangladesh soon after the demolition of the Babri Masjid in India in 1992. Known for her writings on women, human rights and secularism, the firebrand author claimed that madrasas and mosques are being used to brainwash the younger generation in Bangladesh which is becoming another Afghanistan that is controlled Taliban. ""Numerous mosques and madrasas are built in Bangladesh unnecessarily which are used to brainwash the younger generation. In remote villages, preachers speak whatever they want to in the name of Islam. They are misleading young people who are illiterate and do not understand Arabic. So whenever any rumour is spread these kinds of violent incidents happen,"" she said ""What do you want to make your country with this extremism? Another Afghanistan where Taliban is in control?"" she asked. Nasreen said she has been a victim of this extremism throughout her life as her writing are related to women and humanitarian issues. ""It has been 28 years since I was thrown out of the country and still no government has allowed me to enter the country. I defended the minority community in 'Lajja' 28 years ago and still write whenever this kind of issue arises whether it in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afganistan, Syria or anywhere in the world,"" she said. Nasreen feels that economic growth is meaningless if religious tolerance is not there. Madrasas, she said, should be controlled by the government and there should be a strict vigil on what they are teaching. Children should be encouraged to go to a ""secular school and they must have a scientific temper,"" she said. ""Secularism should be promoted and there should be a strict separation between state and religion. You cannot just blame the people who have destroyed Hindu shops, houses or temples. Governments have created all the reasons for them to do this over the years for their vote bank politics which should be stopped,"" said the writer. Taking note of a protest rally against the attack on Hindus in Bangladesh, she said, ""I am very glad that hundreds of people have participated in a protest rally in Chattogram against these incidents in which progressive Muslims also took part"". Social media has played a major part in this as there is a media blackout in Bangladesh, she added.

""These incidents are aimed at tarnishing the image of our nation and creating tension with an eye on the general election. But we won't allow these forces to succeed,"" he said. Violence had erupted in pockets of Bangladesh over an alleged blasphemy incident at a Durga Puja pavilion in Cumilla, around 100 km from Dhaka, following which paramilitary forces were deployed in many affected areas. Sporadic clashes, however, broke out between the police and the bigots as media reported about vandalisation of Hindu temples and Durga puja venues. At least five persons were killed, and scores of others injured in the clashes. Noting that hundreds of people have been arrested, Khan Kamal further said that four rioters have also been shot dead by the police. ""No peace-loving and pious Hindu or Muslim would ever indulge in violence. We are not ruling out the involvement of BNP-Jamaat or any third forces. They could be behind those attacks to halt the progress of our country. This could also be aimed at disturbing peace before the next elections,"" he maintained. Voicing optimism over the ongoing probe, the home minister further said, ""We had asked the puja committees in Cumilla to keep CCTV cameras installed at the pandal and deploy volunteers to keep vigil. But that was not done..."" Allaying India’s concerns over protection of minorities in Bangladesh, Khan Kamal said the government is tackling the situation effectively and progress in investigation is expected soon. ""We think there is no need to be concerned about the minorities here as we are tackling the situation effectively and doing everything possible to protect them. Such attacks on minorities are taking place in other countries too,"" he underlined. Asked if the attacks are related to the renewed rise of fundamentalist forces, encouraged by the establishment of Taliban rule in Afghanistan, Kamal replied in negative. ""This has nothing to do with Taliban rise. Afghanistan is over a thousand miles away from Bangladesh, and the people of our country are not bothered about it,"" he said. Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had last week said that action will be taken again those trying to ""disturb communal harmony"". She also said that the perpetrators will be hunted down and punished. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has noted that the government in the neighbouring country has reacted promptly to ensure that the situation was under control and said that the Indian mission is in close contact with the Bangladeshi authorities over the matter.","These incidents are aimed at tarnishing the image of our nation and creating tension with an eye on the general election. But we won't allow these forces to succeed, saidBangladesh Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal."

Many reached their classes many hours in advance as excitement among students was palpable. In many schools, teachers welcomed their pupils with flowers and chocolates. Guardians were barred from entry into the campuses as a precaution against overcrowding and infection spread. Education Minister Dipu Moni has warned against any lax enforcement of safety measures, while authorities earlier said every class will convene only once a week initially, while schools are to strictly maintain the health guidelines. ""If it appears that the infections were reappearing, the government may decide to re-introduce online classes,"" she told newsmen after visiting a school in the capital's Azimpur area. Bangladesh closed schools on March 17 after the coronavirus began to spread in the country, which has one of the highest population densities in the world.

bangladesh,https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/cattle-smuggling-to-bangladesh-completely-halted-from-south-bengal-front-bsf-report-712528,Cattle smuggling to Bangladesh completely halted from south Bengal front: BSF report,"June 17, 2021, 03:32 PM",2021-06-17,17-6-2021,"There have been zero cattle smuggling incidents to Bangladesh this year from one of the country's most notorious fronts in West Bengal, a first since the Modi government declared in 2014 that the crime has to stop at any cost.  The Kolkata-based south Bengal frontier of the Border Security Force (BSF) is tasked to guard 913.32 kms of the India-Bangladesh international border (IB) out of the total 4,096 kms, running across five states and it has recorded official figures to claim that no cattle was smuggled from its side till May, 2021.Former Union home minister and current defence minister Rajnath Singh, while officiating as the chief guest of the 49th BSF raising day on December 1, 2014 in Delhi, had first told the force that it ""should stop the smuggling of cows and cattle at this border at any cost.""He reiterated this stand at various other public events even as similar assertions were made by other ministers and BJP chief ministers.The data shared with the BSF headquarters in Delhi and the Union home ministry has been accessed by PTI and it says that there has been a ""significant"" curb on this crime under this front, that used to have a 75 per cent share out of the total cattle smuggling prevalent along this border. This frontier has jurisdiction over five border districts of West Bengal: North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas, Nadia, Murshidabad and Malda, and only 405 kms or 44.34 per cent of the boundary is fenced as a large part is riverine, has charlands and at certain places villages are right on the IB. The data said while 710 cattle heads were seized by BSF personnel till May this year, a consistent decline was noticed with 51,443 seizures in 2017, 38,657 in 2018, 29,720 during 2019 and 5,445 cattle seized last year. It adds that zero number of cattle reached Bangladesh from this front this year till May and a similar decline in these numbers was noticed beginning with 8.69 lakh in 2017, 5.22 lakh in 2018, 1.23 lakh in 2019 and 3,628 last year. The data report said as no cattle was smuggled, no government auction of cattle could take place this year in Bangladeshi corridors opposite this frontier like Jessore, Kushtia and Rajshahi. Frontier chief Inspector General (IG) Ashwini Kumar Singh said the figures are believable when asked about the authenticity of the data. ""This data is almost reliable. It is such a long front (under our jurisdiction) and may be 2-4 cattle may have gone un-noticed (to Bangladesh) but I can guarantee that none of the cross-border cattle smugglers has succeeded this year."" ""We have brought cattle smuggling down to zero as compared to handling 75 pc of the total trans-border cattle smuggling to Bangladesh over the last few years,"" Singh said. The data added that due to declining cattle smuggling, leather, beef and porcelain items making industry in Bangladesh has suffered ""a lot of loss"" and the government there has promoted local animal husbandry in order to make farmers and other cattle rearers self-reliant. IG Singh said the ""achievement"" has been the effort of a three-pronged strategy adopted by the force that included motivating field personnel, checking their connivance with smugglers and drawing new operational strategies. ""I told my men that we are here to stop this crime and we need to stop it totally.They worked hard,"" he said. While the IG refused to say as to how many BSF personnel were caught and punished for being hand-in-glove with the smugglers, official sources said the numbers were ""substantial."" BSF Additional Director General (east) Pankaj Kumar Singh had told reporters at Kolkata in January that three force personnel were suspended and six transferred for their alleged involvement in cattle smuggling. BSF south Bengal deputy IG (intelligence) S S Guleria says ""effective border guarding has resulted in completely stopping cattle smuggling to Bangladesh from this front that has been going on since the last four decades or so"". ""We are utilising the gains achieved in cattle smuggling to check other trans-border crimes like human and narcotics trafficking,"" Guleria, a gallantry medal winner, said. As per official data, the south Bengal frontier registered about 400 police FIRs against cattle smugglers or smuggling instances and conducted about 30 joint operations with other law enforcement agencies between 2018-20. A senior home ministry officer, however, said while cattle smuggling figures all along the India-Bangladesh border have drastically gone down beginning 2019, it was ""a work in progress"" to ensure that numbers are brought down to a zero in other areas like the rest of Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya and Tripura. Official records show that a total of 46,809 cattle were seized all along the Bangladesh border in 2020 while the numbers updated till May this year stand at 9,434.","The Kolkata-based south Bengal frontier of the Border Security Force (BSF) is tasked to guard 913.32 kms of the India-Bangladesh international border (IB) out of the total 4,096 kms, running across five states and it has recorded official figures to claim that no cattle was smuggled from its side till May, 2021."

Bangladesh's National Technical Advisory Committee (NTAC) on COVID-19 had earlier suggested the border closure, saying the land routes should not reopen until the situation in India improved. The spokesman said the transportation of goods through the land borders, however, would continue as previously. He said that Bangladeshis who were at risk of being stranded on expiry of visas could return home only through Benapole, Akhaura and Burimari borders, obtaining no-objection certificates from Bangladesh missions in New Delhi, Kolkata and Agartala. The decision came as Bangladesh detected six people, who had recently visited India, infected with the Indian variant of the COVID-19. Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) spokesman Professor Dr Nazmul Islam Munna said the cases were detected by health officials overnight. Out of the six people, two were detected in capital Dhaka. ""Six people have been found to be carrying the Indian variant so far and we expect more people to be detected with identical types of virus in the coming days,"" Munna said.

The official confirmed the development while speaking to IANS.   According to the official, a Special Action Group of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police's (DMP) Counter-Terrorism and Transnational Crime Unit (CTTC), had arrested two AI militants, Awal Newaz alias Sohel Newaz and Fazle Rabbi Chowdhury, in September 2019. During interrogation, they said the militant groups had been receiving huge funds through the Bitcoin system since 2014. The two also mentioned that they collected huge sums of money from Pakistan and Gulf countries also in the form of cryptocurrency. The militants claimed that earlier they used to collect money through 'hundi', but that is now under the surveillance of the law enforcers. Due to this, they shifted to Bitcoin, which according to the militants, is an easier method to exchange the illegal funds used in organising radical activities. Ahmedul Islam, the Additional Deputy Commissioner of the Special Action Group, told IANS that terror financing is largely being carried out with the help of cryptocurrency. ""It's very tough to monitor the illegal transaction of Bitcoin as we have not advanced technical devices to monitor it. ""It'll be a big challenge for the law enforcers to check the virtual currency in the future,"" he added. In August 2020, the US government had announced that hundreds of cryptocurrency accounts, four websites, and four Facebook accounts were seized, adding that it thwarted attempts by militant groups to raise funds using digital currency. According to US officials, about $2 million in cryptocurrency had been recovered. In Bangladesh, virtual currency is banned. In December 2017, the Bangladesh Bank issued a notice asking everyone to refrain from such transactions. The Criminal Investigation Department (CID), DMP, and some other police units are working to check illegal virtual transactions in the country. A cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of computerised database.","Banned Bangladeshi militant outfits, Ansar Al Islam (AI) and Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT), have sent a huge amount of money to another extremist group in Kashmir in the form of cryptocurrency, a senior police official said."

bangladesh,https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/pm-modi-bangladesh-visit-bengal-polls-2021-688527,Why PM Modi's Bangladesh visit around Bengal polls is a 'smart move',"March 03, 2021, 02:48 PM",2021-03-03,3-3-2021,"On the day West Bengal witnesses the first of its eight-phase state assembly elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi may be heading for an unusual shrine in Bangladesh -- Orakandi. Orakandi is not far from Tungipara in Gopalgunj, the ancestral home of 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and daughter Sheikh Hasina, the now Prime Minister of Bangladesh.   It is the most sacred shrine of the 'Matua' community, a Hindu sect whose numbers are considerable both in West Bengal and Bangladesh. Modi will reach Bangladesh on March 26, the day observed in Bangladesh as Independence Day when in 1971, Pakistan's brutal army unleashed 'Operation Searchlight', the genocide of Bengalis in tens of thousands that sparked the country's struggle for freedom. Modi has already expressed his desire to visit Tungipara, where the 'Bangabandhu' lies buried and the visit has been scheduled for March 27 after necessary security clearance arrangements by both Indian and Bangladesh security agencies. March 27 is when West Bengal goes to its first phase of polls. But Bangladesh security officials say they now have a fresh request, Modi wants a visit to Orakandi to pay respects to the Harichand Thakur, the founder of the Matua sect, who was born there on March 11, 1812. ""We are examining the security aspects of the proposed visit of Indian PM to Orakandi and once we are satisfied, we will clear the trip,"" said a top Bangladesh security official. But he was unwilling to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media. Other Bangladesh officials say that the clearance is a mere formality because Bangladeshis usually don't deny visiting Indian dignitaries if they want to visit any part of the country for personal reasons. For instance, late Indian President Pranab Mukherjee would always visit the ancestral home of his wife in Narail. Harichand Thakur formed the Matua Mahasangha and pitched it as a religious reformation movement around 1860 AD after attaining 'atmadarshan' in Orakandi in what is now Gopalgunj district (part of greater Faridpur) in today's Bangladesh. Thakur's teachings establish education as pre-eminently important for the adherent and the upliftment of the population the adherent's duty, while also providing a formula for ending the social conflict. Matua-Mahasangha believes in 'Swayam-Dikshiti' (Self-Realisation). So anyone who has faith in the Darshan or Philosophy of God Harichand belongs to the Matua Mahasanga. Santanu Thakur, the present leader of the Matua Mahasangha, is the BJP MP from Bongaon, his father Manjul Krishna Thakur was a former Minister in the state. The 'Matua' vote is believed to be a decisive factor in the North 24-Parganas and Nadia district and the BJP is involved in a huge tussle with the Trinamool Congress (TMC) to win over the community whose numbers in Bangladesh, West Bengal and elsewhere is said to be close to 3 crores. The Matuas have strongly pushed for the Citizenship Amendment Act to ensure Indian citizenship for a large chunk of the community who moved into West Bengal from Bangladesh after the Partition and especially after the 2001-02 anti-Hindu pogroms during the Khaleda Zia government in Bangladesh. Despite no clear estimate, experts feel the Matua numbers are evenly divided in Bangladesh and West Bengal with a sprinkling elsewhere in India and outside. Mamata Banerjee is close to 'Boro Ma' Mamatabala Thakur, the mother figure of the community, while Santanu is the first non-TMC MP from the community. ""If Modi manages to visit the Orakandi shrine and pray there, he would be the first Indian PM to have done so. That may touch a chord with the Matuas and swing their support towards BJP in the West Bengal polls,"" says Bangladesh watcher Sukhoranjan Dasgupta. ""It is a smart move.' Dasgupta is the author of ""Midnight Massacre"", a detailed account of the 1975 coup that killed Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with much of his family. Analyst Ashis Biswas says the proposed Modi visit to Tungipara and Orakandi is a classic ""two birds with one stone"" move. ""The visit to Tungipara will doubtlessly go down well with Prime Minister Hasina and all pro-liberation forces in Bangladesh and revive memories of India's role in Bangladesh's liberation. The visit to Orakandi may help the BJP's cause with the Matuas,"" said Biswas.","Modi will reach Bangladesh on March 26, the day observed in Bangladesh as Independence Day, when in 1971, Pakistan's brutal army unleashed 'Operation Searchlight', the genocide of Bengalis in tens of thousands that sparked the country's struggle for freedom."

The United Nations has also voiced concern that refugees be allowed to make a “free and informed decision” about whether to relocate to the island in the Bay of Bengal.The island’s facilities are built to accommodate 100,000 people, just a fraction of the million Rohingya Muslims who have fled waves of violent persecution in their native Myanmar and are currently living in crowded, squalid refugee camps.On Thursday, 11 passenger buses carrying refugees left Cox’s Bazar district on the way to the island, where they are expected to arrive after an overnight stopover, a government official involved with the process said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.He said “a few thousand” refugees were in the first batch. Authorities in Cox’s Bazar did not say how the refugees were selected for relocation.About 700,000 Rohingya fled to the camps in Cox’s Bazar after August 2017, when the military in Buddhist-majority Myanmar began a harsh crackdown on the Muslim group following an attack by insurgents. The crackdown included rapes, killings and the torching of thousands of homes, and was termed ethnic cleansing by global rights groups and the U.N.Foreign media have not been permitted to visit the island, called Bhashan Char, or floating island. It was once regularly submerged by monsoon rains but now has flood protection embankments, houses, hospitals and mosques built at a cost of more than $112 million by the Bangladesh navy.Located 21 miles (34 kilometers) from the mainland, the island surfaced only 20 years ago and was never inhabited. Contractors say its infrastructure is like a modern township, with multifamily concrete homes, schools, playgrounds and roads. It also has solar-power facilities, a water supply system and cyclone shelters.International aid agencies and the U.N. have vehemently opposed the relocation since it was first proposed in 2015, expressing fear that a big storm could overwhelm the island and endanger thousands of lives.The U.N. said in a statement Wednesday that it has not been involved in preparations for the relocation or the selection of refugees and has limited information about the overall plan.“The United Nations takes this opportunity to highlight its longstanding position that Rohingya refugees must be able to make a free and informed decision about relocating to Bhasan Char based upon relevant, accurate and updated information,” it said.Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch on Thursday urged the government to cancel the relocation plan.The current refugee camps near the town of Cox’s Bazar are overcrowded and unhygienic. Disease and organized crime are rampant. Education is limited and refugees are not allowed to work.Still, most Rohingya are unwilling to return to Myanmar due to safety concerns. Government officials didn’t have an estimate of how many refugees would be willing to be relocated to the island.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has repeatedly told the U.N. and other international partners that her administration would consult them before making a final decision on the relocation, and that no refugees would be forced to move.Bangladesh attempted to start sending refugees back to Myanmar under a bilateral framework last November, but no one was willing to go.AD The Rohingya are not recognized as citizens in Myanmar, rendering them stateless, and face other forms of state-sanctioned discrimination. A U.N.-sponsored investigation in 2018 recommended the prosecution of Myanmar’s top military commanders on charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity for the violence against the Rohingya. Myanmar is defending itself in the International Court of Justice in the Hague, Netherlands, after the West African nation of Gambia brought a case backed by the Organization for Islamic Cooperation, Canada and the Netherlands over the crackdown.

More than 100 students of any age can study in the non-residential Islamic school, Dawatul Quran Third Gender Madrasa, at Lohar Bridge Dhal in Kamrangirchar, the bdnews24.com reported. At the inauguration on Friday, 40 transgender people joined.   Besides the Islamic teachings, the madrasa authorities also plan to launch a separate department of technical education for the transgender people. The government passed a policy in 2013 recognising the members of the Hijra community as of the “third gender”. The Election Commission allowed the registration of the transgender people as “third gender” voters the following year. They have stood in elections as well. Abdul Aziz Husaini, one of the 10 trainers at the madrasa, said that it is a memorable day for the entire world because the first known Islamic school for the transgender people has been launched, the news website reported. “They face deprivation, neglect in society. They can’t even say their prayers at the mosque. They will be given lessons from the Quran now. Their technical education will begin later,” he was quoted as saying. The trainers are already teaching the transgender people the Quran at eight places in the city, he said. Mitu, the president of Hijra Kalyan Foundation, said the transgender people would become assets if they could be employed. Nishi, a 27-year old transgender person from Bikrampur, said she had gone to school and moktob, a community-based Islamic school, when she was a child, but no one allowed her into the school and the moktob when the people came to know she was a transgender. “I left home when I was 5 to 6 years old. I’ve stepped into a madrasa again after so many years. It’s a moment of immense joy for me,” she said. She said she liked to do makeup and sewing, and would like to take to these trades if she got the opportunity. “I want to learn something before entering the job market. I won’t need to look around for a livelihood then,” Nishi said.","A madrasa has been opened for transgenders in Bangladesh's capital city Dhaka, believed to be the first-of-its-kind initiative for the community in the Muslim-majority country."

However, human rights activists said that Wednesday's verdict was just a little progress and not an achievement.   ""This verdict is of course one step forward in the fight for the establishment of equality between men and women. But there's still a long way to go to achieve the goal for equal rights of Hindu women,"" Advocate and activist, Dipty Sikder said.

Barrister Syed Nafiul Islam, one of the lawyers for the plaintiff said: ""After this verdict, they (widows) will get a share of agricultural land too."" The strictest part of the Hindu law in the country is the distribution of property among girls. Enacted in 1937, the law deprived women of the right to inherit their husbands' properties. One Jyotindra Nath Mandal of Khulna filed a case in 1996 seeking a court order to deprive his dead brother's wife (sister-in-law) of their father's assets. The lower court said that widows had rights only to the area of the houses in which they lived, and not to agricultural property. Later, the district judge expressed a different opinion, that widows also had rights to agricultural land in the same manner as their husbands. The matter was then brought to the High Court.

bangladesh,https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/pakistan-bangladesh-relations-imran-khan-sheikh-hasina-640010,Why Imran Khan govt is trying to woo Bangladesh?,"August 06, 2020, 03:37 PM",2020-08-06,6-8-2020,"When Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had visited Delhi, Pakistan’s Deputy High Commissioner Sayed Haider visited her and conveyed her that the Imran Khan had sent his best wishes. Even before Hasina landed in Delhi, the Pakistan Prime Minister spoke to her over phone for about 15 minutes.   What is the big deal? This is general diplomacy.I spoke to an Indian officer, who was unwilling to accept this that straightforward. His question was, ‘Alright, did you know that Sheikh Hasina was invited by Imran Khan to Islamabad? ’ My answer was: How am I supposed to know what they have possibly discussed? Neither Sheikh Hasina nor Imran Khan had informed me what they have spoken about. But inviting to one’s own country is courteousness. In the diplomatic circles such exchange has its meaning. Having covered it for decades, I understood what the talk was all about. It is the timing of the call that is significant. Today India’s dispute with Pakistan is in extremes. Since 1971, when Bangladesh was formed after fighting the Liberation War with the Pakistan army, till today so many things have changed. Pakistan wants to be friends with Bangladesh. China, Afghanistan, Iran all want to maintain a good relationship with Dhaka. Everyone knows about the importance of position of the small country situated in South Asia. It has a tremendous impact concerning geographical strategy. It isn’t surprising for China, Pakistan, Russia to try form a good relation with Bangladesh. India also wants to maintain a good relations with Bangladesh. It needs a proactive diplomacy to do that. It is precisely for this reason that Prime Minister is sending Vikram Doraiswami to Dhaka as the high commissioner. Harsh Vardhan Shringla was quite active as the High Commissioner in Dhaka. Under Shringla’s presence the importance of Indian High Commission in Dhaka increased. Even his dedication towards Bangladesh was unprecedented. When he was the acting Joint Secretary of Bangladesh since then I have watched him to be most active, and Smita Pant a suitable junior officer of Shringla. At the ground floor in South Block at Shringla’s office, when we used to talk about Bangladesh, he listened to new ideas. His down to earth approach was highly admirable. He always discarded the snobbish, aristocratic IFS-like incoherency. This person from Darjeeling through the staircase of success from Bangladesh to the Ambassador in the United States and today has become state’s Foreign Secretary. Meanwhile, Bengali diplomats like Riva Ganguly Das is being brought back in Delhi in the former post as secretary and instead Vikram Doraiswami is being sent. Despite being Tamil, he can speak a little Bengali. It is because his wife’s mother is Bengali and Mrs Doraiswami is comfortable in Bengali.Vikram Doraiswami belongs to the Foreign Service batch of 1992. He was in charge of International Organizations and various summits. Today India has a lot of expectations from Vikram. Dhaka would also have put its expectations on Vikram. This radiant 45—year-young man was the personal secretary of Dr Manmohan Singh. I have seen him closely work in the Race Course Road, outside Manmohan Singh’s chamber in a tiny room where he used to sit and do the work as his personal secretary. I’ve seen how he had gathered his experience in diplomacy from various countries. In our country from Indira to Rajiv even during the era of Narsimha Rao , there used to be only one personal secretary, and appointed an IAS that is Indian Administrative Service youth. After Atal Bihari Bajpayee became the Prime Minister, IAS Brajesh Mishra became his principal secretary and National Security Advisor. He introduced the custom of the appointment of two personal secretaries of the Prime Minister. One an IAS who will look after country’s internal affairs, will maintain contact between the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Chief Ministers and Governors. The other one will be IFS , Foreign Ministry Officer. He will be the Prime Minister’s liaison with the Foreign Minister and all other statesmen in the world. Although Shakti Sinha was an IAS officer at that time, Ajay Bisaria of the Foreign Service became another Private Secretary. Today he is India High Commissioner in Pakistan. Manmohan Singh did not stop this custom after coming in power. Out of two private secretaries one of them was Vikram. Vikram has done his graduation in History from Delhi University became. He then worked as a journalist. Hence in his DNA, there lies the espial capacity to that of a journalist. After the training ended in the year 1994, he went to Hong Kong. The institution in Hong Kong was under China University. In the year 1996 he went to Beijing. He worked there for four years. Later, Vikram became the Deputy Chief of Protocols in Delhi. Then in New York, he became a Political Counselor in Indian Permanent High Commission to the United Nations. In his careers he has had postings at various key places across the globe. Today, when he is going to Dhaka, he is the favourite of Foreign Minister Jayashakar and Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla . Do you know why I am saying this? I am saying this because if there is a direct relationship at the top level, that diplomat can easily make many decisions in other countries. It will cut the bureaucratic red tape. He is one of the blue-eyed boys of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Sheikh Hasina knows him well. Therefore, it will be easier to fulfill the demands and the issues in Bangladesh. Indo-Bangladesh relations is highly likely to be strengthened with Vikram’s Dhaka appointment.","When Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had visited Delhi, Pakistan’s Deputy High Commissioner Sayed Haider visited her and conveyed her that the Imran Khan had sent his best wishes.

From the Bangladesh side, the online ceremony was attended by Minister of Railway Md. Nurul Islam Sujan and Minister of Foreign Affairs Abul Kalam Abdul Momen. Speaking on the occasion, Jaishankar highlighted the depth of ""time tested"" relationship between India and Bangladesh based on mutual trust and respect. He expressed happiness that the COVID-19 pandemic has not slowed down the pace of bilateral cooperation and conveyed that he looked forward to more such ""milestones"" in the current year marking the birth centenary of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. In his comments, Goyal underscored the significance of railway cooperation in enhancing bilateral trade and connectivity and in further boosting the economic partnership between the two countries.

""In keeping with the requirements of Bangladesh Railway, the locomotives have been suitably modified by the Indian side. These locomotives will help handle the increasing volume of passenger and freight train operations in Bangladesh,"" it said. The ten 3300 HP WDM3D locomotives given to Bangladesh are fit for running for more than 28 years, officials said. They are suitable for hauling freight as well as passenger trains and have a microprocessor-based control system. The current cost of these 10 locos is approximately Rs 60 crore, which is being borne by the Indian government, officials said. Bangladesh had sent a proposal to India in April last year for procurement of these locos, as 72 per cent of its present ones have already crossed their economic life. In the recent times, the MEA said, India and Bangladesh have stepped up cooperation between their railways in mitigating the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic as trade via land border faced disruptions. ""Rail, as a cost effective and environmental friendly solution, has helped in transporting essential commodities across the border.Both sides saw the highest ever exchange of freight trains in the month of June,"" it said, adding a total of 103 freight trains were utilised for carrying essential commodities and raw materials. ""Recently, parcel and container train services have also commenced between India and Bangladesh.This is expected to significantly enhance the scope of bilateral trade,"" it said.

The infected Rohingya and a local Bangladeshi who lives in the Cox’s Bazar district who also tested positive have been isolated, Mahbub Alam Talukder, the country’s refugee commissioner, said Thursday.   Teams have been activated to treat the patients as well as trace people they may have encountered, Louise Donovan, a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency, told The Associated Press. Nationwide, Bangladesh has confirmed 18,863 cases, including 283 fatalities. But the toll is thought to be higher since adequate testing facilities are lacking in the South Asian nation of 160 million people. Aid workers have been warning of the potential for a serious outbreak if the virus spread into the densely populated camps. Donovan said Thursday that 108 Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar have been tested for the coronavirus since the beginning of April. With about 40,000 people per square kilometer (103,600 per square mile) living in plastic shacks side by side, the 34 camps have more than 40 times Bangladesh’s average population density. Each shack is barely 10 square meters (107 square feet) and many are packed with up to 12 residents. Some refugees remained worried, saying they lacked access to clean water and protective equipment. “Here in the camps it’s difficult to protect our health from the virus because there are so many people in a small place,” said Ro Sawyeddollah, a camp resident and executive director of the Rohingya Students Union. The U.N. and the government said about 1,200 beds for isolating and treating COVID-19 patients were being readied just outside the camps at Ukhiya and Teknaf in Cox’s Bazar, and more were planned. Aid agencies and rights groups have been demanding Bangladesh’s government withdraw restrictions on using mobile phones and internet in the camps. Authorities had suspended internet use for security reasons, and recent reports said armed groups among the refugees were allegedly involved in kidnappings and smuggling of drugs. “Because of COVID-19, people can’t meet one another, so it’s impossible to share any messages or information without the internet,” said Ro Sawyeddollah. Daniel P. Sullivan, a human rights advocate for aid group Refugees International, said the lack of accurate information is fueling misinformation, and “rumors abound in the camps that COVID-19 is always fatal or that the faithful will be safe.” Most of the Rohingya have fled Myanmar since August 2017, when Myanmar’s military launched counterinsurgency operations in response to rebel attacks. Security forces have been accused of mass rapes, killings and burning thousands of homes. Authorities in Myanmar have long considered the Muslim Rohingya to be migrants from Bangladesh, even though their families have lived in the Buddhist-majority country for centuries. Nearly all have been denied citizenship since 1982, effectively rendering them stateless. They are also denied freedom of movement and other basic rights including education.","The first coronavirus case has been confirmed in the crowded camps for Rohingya refugees in southern Bangladesh, where more than 1 million are taking shelter."

The envoy said the celebrations on March 17, which coincide with the 100th birth anniversary of Sheikh Mujib -- referred to as ""Bangabandhu"" or the father of the Bengali Nation -- will kick off a year-long series of events in Bangladesh as well as the UK. ""Prime Minister Modi is among the special guests invited to the centenary, which also has intrinsic links with Bangabandhu's homecoming in 1971,"" Tasneem told PTI in an interview. ""The roadmap of that journey is that he first stopped in London, where he was officially recognised as the president of the independent state of Bangladesh and had bilateral meetings at 10 Downing Street. Then he was flown to Delhi, where he held a public gathering with (then Indian prime minister) Indira Gandhi,"" she recalled. The diplomat traced the active role played by Gandhi at the time alongside the then UK prime minister, Edward Heath, to seek Sheikh Mujib's release from Karachi Jail in Pakistan. ""They collectively played a very proactive role in the release of Bangabandhu and to ensure that he was not harmed in any way. So, at the very genesis of Bangladesh, the relationships were clear and the Bangladesh-India ties remain as strong till date, as do the UK-Bangladesh ties,"" she said. In reference to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), which was passed by the Indian Parliament in December last year to grant citizenship rights to persecuted minorities from three neighbouring countries including Bangladesh, the envoy said the implication of the law was ""hurtful"" to Bangladesh. ""The Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, has said it is an internal matter of India but also quite unnecessary. Bengali Hindus in Bangladesh have done very well for themselves, especially in the financial sphere, as they have a particular skill with mathematics and accounts,"" she said.

The official said that when the fire was brought under control, firefighters found ""10 bodies on the second floor,"" and that there were no other fatalities or injuries in the blaze. Fires and other dangerous industrial incidents are rather regular occurrences in Bangladesh, a country that has been under international scrutiny in recent years due to the precarious safety conditions in its factories, although it appears that authorities have been unable to reduce those overall risks. According to figures from the Bangladesh Firefighters Service, between 2004 and 2018 at least 1,970 people died in the heavily populated and poverty-stricken South Asian country in the 89,923 fires reported during that time. Last week, at least 17 people lost their lives in a fire in a plastics factory on the capital's outskirts. Last February a massive fire in the old section of Dacca almost completely destroyed seven buildings, killing at least 70 people and injuring 55. That fire began in a building housing a warehouse for plastic products. The worst industrial accident in Bangladesh's history occurred in 2013, when 1,134 people died and more than 2,500 were injured when the eight-story Rana Plaza building housing five textile workshops collapsed.","The fire department said that the blaze broke out about 5:45 pm in an electric fan factory in Gazipur, near the Bangladeshi capital and that when it was finally put out 10 bodies were found in the charred ruins of the establishment, the Efe news reported."

We can't reveal any more details at this stage,"" confirmed the official.   Momin was slated to arrive in New Delhi on Thursday evening on a three-day visit, as per a press release by the Ministry of External Affairs on Wednesday evening. During his visit, Momin was slated to attend the Delhi Dialogue and the Indian Ocean Dialogue, latter being a crucial event on India’s Indo-Pacific strategy calendar. Momin was also scheduled tohold bilateral talks with Union External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar. Along with Indonesia’s foreign minister Retno Marsudi, another high-profile guest at the Track 1.5 events, Momin was lined up as aspeaker at the combined session of Delhi and the Indian Ocean Dialogues. The MEA had said in its original release that the two events wereaimed at fostering understanding among countries towards building an “open, free and an inclusive approach for a cooperative, free and rules-based Indo-Pacific region.” The emerging security architecture in the region has been necessitated by China’s alleged violations of the marine laws in the South China Sea and its increasing muscle-flexing in the Indian Ocean region. “Through these processes, India intends to emphasise its open and inclusive approach to fostering a cooperative, free and rules-based Indo-Pacific domain, in which all nations and their aspirations for development have equal space to find expression,” the MEA had said. Incidentally, the visit of Momin was scheduled to take place a day after the Rajya Sabha passed the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, a legislation guaranteeingIndian citizenship for members of six minority communities — Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian — hailing from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Union Home Minister Amit Shah, during the discussions on the bill in the Parliament, reasoned that minorities in the said countries were prone to religious persecution since all of their constitutions had Islam as thestate-sanctioned religion. “While India has kept its part of promise in affording protection to minorities since Independence, our neighbours haven’t kept their side of the bargain,” Shah said during a debate in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday. ""Whereas, the minority population in Pakistan has decreased from 23 per cent in 1947 to 3.7 per cent in 2011. Similarly, minority population in Bangladesh has decreased from 22 per cent in 1947 to 7 per cent in 2011,"" the Union Home Minister also pointed out during several rounds of debate on the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill. Shah’s comments and the passage of the bill in the Parliament had drawn sharp reactions from the Bangladesh foreign minister, who rejected the claim that minorities were unsafe in Bangladesh. “There are a very few countries where communal harmony is as good as in Bangladesh. If he (Amit Shah) stayed in Bangladesh for a few months, he would see exemplary communal harmony in our country,” Momin was quoted as saying in the Bangladeshi media. While the Citizenship Amendment Bill was expected to feature in the talks between Momin and Jaishankar, India hasmaintained that “every nation has the right to enumerate and validate its citizenry, and to exercise the prerogative through various policies.”","In a last-minute development, Bangladesh's foreign minister AK Abdul Momin cancelled his three-day visit to India.

The accused were sentenced by a special Bangladeshi tribunal for their involvement in the 2016 Islamist attack on a Dhaka cafe. At least 20 people had lost their lives in the incident, making it the worst attack in the history of the country. The convicts were found to have financed, supplied weapons, or assisted those who directly took part in the attack on Holey Artisan Bakery in Dhaka's up market Gulshan area on July 1, 2016.   ""They shall be hanged by neck until their death,"" Dhaka's Anti-Terrorism Special Tribunal judge Mojibur Rahman pronounced at the crowded court complex in Old Dhaka as the convicts appeared in the dock under heavy security. The judge acquitted the eighth suspect as the prosecution side could not prove his links to the attack by the outlawed Neo-Jamaatul Mujahideen Bangladesh (Neo-JMB). Investigators earlier said that all the five neo-JMB operatives who directly took part in the attack were killed the next morning in a counter-assault by the military commandos. The counter-attack, however, killed an employee of the bakery and fatally wounded another who succumbed to his wounds two days later. The 17 foreigners killed in the attack included nine Italians, seven Japanese, one Indian girl. Two Bangladeshi police officers were also killed during the siege. The Indian girl, Tarishi Jain, a student of the University of California in Berkeley, was among those killed in the attack. She was in Dhaka on vacation. The judge in his verdict identified Bangladeshi Canadian Tamim Chowdhury as the mastermind of the attack, who later was killed during a nationwide anti-militancy security clampdown. The verdict simultaneously observed that Chowdhury tried to draw Islamic State (IS) support to militant attacks in Bangladesh. The IS had immediately claimed responsibility for the Holey Artisan attack and several other subsequent militant assaults in the country. But Bangladesh repeatedly declined the presence of any foreign terrorist group in the country attributing the incidents to homegrown terrorists. Security analysts and officials, however, said several Bangladeshi homegrown militant groups were in touch with or influenced by international terrorist outfits. The trial in the case started after the Counter-Terrorism and Transnational Crime unit submitted a chargesheet on July 23, 2018, after two years of investigation.

The ship, MV AAI of the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI), was digitally flagged off by Indian Minister of State for Shipping Mansukh Mandaviya on July 12. The ship then sailed from Dhubri in Assam and travelled to Narayanganj in Bangladesh, over the river Brahmaputra, the statement said. Dhubri was declared a port of call in October 2018. This is the first time an Indian waterway is being used as a channel for transport of cargo between the two countries, using India for transit, it said. The stone aggregates were transported by trucks from Phuentsholing in Bhutan which is 160 kilometres from IWAI's Dhubri jetty in Assam. Bhutan was exporting significant quantities of stone aggregates to Bangladesh through the land route. Mandaviya said the development is a historic one and takes forward Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision to promote cargo transportation through inland waterways. He said the move will benefit India, Bhutan and Bangladesh and will strengthen relations between the neighbouring countries. Transport of cargo through this route will cut short travel time by 8 to 10 days, and reduce transportation cost by 30 per cent, bringing down logistics costs, Mandaviya said, adding that it will also be a more environment-friendlymode of transport.

Banerjee said the flow of the Atreyee water into India had been artificially restricted on the Bangladesh side and was creating problems for the people of the district. The chief minister was replying to a question in the assembly by Revolutionary Socialist Party legislator Narmada Chandra Roy. The MLA from Kushmandi in South Dinajpur asked the government about the steps it was taking to alleviate the problems of the people in the area due to lack of water flow in the river. Banerjee said she had taken up the issue of lack of water in the river on the Indian side with the Bangladesh prime minister two-three times and also with the Indian prime minister. She said it was unfortunate that the matter had not been taken up with due urgency by the Union government with its Bangladesh counterpart, even though the people of South Dinajpur continue to suffer. The river originates near Siliguri in north Bengal, flows into Bangladesh before entering South Dinajpur. After meandering through Balurghat and Kumarganj blocks, it flows again into the neighbouring country. Banerjee said even if heavy rains occur in Jharkhand and Bihar or in neighbouring country Bhutan, West Bengal had to bear the brunt of floods due to its geographical position. Rivers from these states and Bhutan flow into West Bengal, and it leads to floods, the chief minister said, adding that the issue had been taken up with the Centre. India also has a long-standing issue with Bangladesh over the sharing of Teesta river water. Last Tuesday, Banerjee had contended that Bangladesh was ""hurt"" over the Teesta dispute, saying she would have shared water from the river with the neighbouring country had the situation been favourable.

The World Heritage Committee of 21 governments is scheduled to decide on the recommendations by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in its annual meeting in Azerbaijan from June 30 to July 10, the bdnews24.com reported. The Sundarbans mangrove forest, one of the largest such forests in the world (140,000 ha), lies on the delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers on the Bay of Bengal. It is adjacent to the border of India’s Sundarbans World Heritage site inscribed in 1987. The recommendation came after the UNESCO in July, 2017, withdrew a plan to inscribe the Sundarbans in the list of heritage sites in danger by 2018 in case of the failure to meet the mission's recommendations. A reactive monitoring mission, jointly conducted by the Centre and IUCN in March 2016, made detailed recommendations including the necessity of a strategic environmental assessment for the south-west region of the country. After the mission, the World Heritage Committee had called for the Rampal power plant project to be cancelled and relocated. The Bangladesh government had been allowed until December 2018 at the time to report on the conservation of the world's largest mangrove forest to the World Heritage Centre, the website reported. The committee had welcomed Bangladesh's decision to carry out the assessment into the potential impact of a coal-based thermal plant at Rampal on the Sundarbans, besides the decisions to scrap the plant's second phase and also the Orion power plant.

At least one person fell to the ground while trying to climb down the building. Fire officials said after battling the blaze for several hours that most people inside had been rescued. “The situation is under control,” said Debashish Bardhan, a Fire Service and Civil Defense deputy director.

The flight, en route Dubai from Dhaka via Chattogram, made an emergency landing at the Shah Amanat International Airport in the coastal city of Chattogram following the hijack bid. Army, Navy and elite police cordoned off the plane soon after it landing. All the passengers, pilots and crew members were evacuated safely.

Meanwhile, in a press conference in Dhaka, Bangladesh Civil Aviation Authority (CAAB) Chairman Air Vice Marshal Naim Hassan said the hijacker was equipped with a hand gun and explosives. An investigation would be carried out to determine how the man boarded the aircraft with arms and explosives, he said.

Officials said the fire broke out at night a chemical warehouse on the ground floor of a four-storey building named Hazi Wahed Mansion behind a mosque in Old Dhaka's congested Chawkbazar area on Wednesday night and the flames then quickly spread through four other buildings nearby, including a community centre where a wedding party was on. ""The salvage campaign is ending here,"" mayor of Dhaka South Sayeed Khokon said. Fire officials said that the blaze has claimed 81 lives so far. Dhaka Metropolitan Police officials said the fire spread rapidly due to the multiple chemical godowns that were situated in the area. Fire service control room spokesman Kamrul Ahsan confirmed the death toll to be 81 while state-run Dhaka Medical College Hospital's director Brigadier General AKM Nasiruddin said 78 bodies were kept at their disposal. Nasiruddin, however, feared that the toll may rise as several people were being treated at the facility with critical burn injuries. Khokon called off the rescue operation around 12:10 PM after nearly 14 hours of efforts. Two-hundred fire-fighters from 37 units doused the blaze, making their way to the scene through narrow lanes with fire engines. ""Some of the bodies were burned very badly, difficult to be identified... of the victims, five are children and nine women,"" a doctor said. Bangladesh's fire service chief Ali Ahmed said the blaze may have started with a gas cylinder before quickly spreading through the building where chemicals were stored. ""The flames raced through four adjoining buildings, which were also used as chemical warehouses. There was a traffic jam when the fire broke out. It spread so quickly that people could not escape,"" he said. TV images showed the main gate of one of the buildings was locked, leaving its residents trapped, unable to escape the blaze as it swept through its five storeys. Witnesses said the victims also included passersby, some people who were eating food at a nearby restaurants and some members of a wedding party. Over 50 people, including women and children, were also injured and admitted to nearby hospitals, including Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) and Sir Salimullah Medical College Hospital. Some of the residents were injured after they jumped off the building. The district administration will provide 20,000 taka (USD 238) to the victims' families for burial, Additional Deputy Commissioner Shafiqul said. The officials said narrow lanes made it difficult for the fire engines to reach the spot. The fire fighters used helicopters and long hose pipes to set off the blaze. President Abdul Hamid and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina mourned the casualties and ordered the best possible treatment for those injured. State-run facilities were asked to provide free of cost services to the injured. The four-storey building where the fire started is at the risk of collapsing due to damage, according to media reports. The first floor of the building was being used as a warehouse of plastic goods, cosmetics and perfume. Some families lived on the upper floors, according to residents. The ground floor of the building, where the fire originated, had several shops. The fire from the building immediately caused an electric transformer to explode, which set ablaze several cars parked on the alley. The alley was packed with people because of a wedding ceremony that was being held in the nearby community centre. An investigation panel has been formed to identify the reason behind the fire. The fire brings back the terrifying memories of another massive blaze in 2010 in an old Dhaka building at Nimtoli, which was also used as a chemical warehouse, that killed more than 120 people in one of the worst fire tragedies in Bangladesh. It had sparked a public outcry, demanding the relocation of chemical warehouses and stores from the area, but little has been done in the last nine years. The authorities had listed 800 warehouses in the neighbourhood for their transfer to Keraniganj on the outskirts of the capital. The lack of safety regulations in the country was highlighted in 2013 when over 1,100 people died and thousands more were injured when a building housing garment factories in Dhaka collapsed.","A fast-moving fire swept through adjoining apartment buildings and chemical warehouses in a historic part of the Bangladesh capital Dhaka, killing at least 81 people and injuring several others, the latest such deadly blaze in the country."

The majority of those who are likely to apply for Indian citizenship under the Citizenship Amendment Bill will be from Pakistan, as nearly 35,000 of such people have got LTVs so far. “The number of LTVs issued by the Union Home Ministry to Bangladeshi nationals from 2011 to January 8, 2019, is just 187, while total LTVs issued to Pakistani nationals during the same period is 34,817,” the official told PTI. Those who will apply for Indian citizenship under the Citizenship Amendment Bill must fulfil similar criteria of LTVs. “There cannot be too many Bangladeshis applying for the Indian nationality under the proposed new law. Otherwise, they would have already taken the LTVs for which criteria are the same,” the official said. Of the 187 LTVs granted to Bangladeshi nationals, only two were given in 2018, three in 2017, 50 LTVs were given in 2016, 26 LTVs were issued in 2015, 74 in 2014, 27 in 2012 and four in 2011. No LTV was issued to any Bangladeshi national in 2013.

The West Indies collapsed around Hope, who carried the bat throughout the innings for his fourth ton to steer the side to 198/9.

Attorney General Mahbubey Alam said the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson, who is convicted in two graft cases, cannot contest the upcoming 11th general election next month. ""She is disqualified from taking part in the upcoming elections,"" Alam told a press conference, hours after the High Court issued a rule saying persons jailed for more than two years even if their appeals are pending with the courts cannot contest the polls. The 73-year-old ex-premier is currently serving jail terms in two graft cases involving charities named after her slain husband Ziaur Rahman. She has been in custody since February 8, when Dhaka Special Court convicted her in the Zia Orphanage Trust graft case and sentenced her to five years of imprisonment for embezzling 21 million Bangladeshi Taka (USD 252,504) in foreign donations meant for the Trust. On October 30, the High Court doubled her jail term to 10 years. On October 29, a trial court convicted her in the Zia Charitable Trust graft case and sentenced her to seven years in prison and imposed a fine of Tk 1 million (USD 12,024). The High Court order came as the BNP, which boycotted the 2014 elections under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League (AL) government, was set to contest the polls in alliance with the newly formed National Unity Front (NUF) led by eminent jurist Kamal Hossain. The chief state counsel said even if Zia was released from jail before November 28, the deadline of filing the nomination papers, the Constitution would not allow her to contest the polls and ""she will have to wait for five more years after her acquittal to take part in the elections"". As per Bangladesh's Constitution, a person sentenced to imprisonment for two years or above for a criminal offence cannot take part in an election unless five years have elapsed since his/her release. The two-judge High Court bench comprising Justice Mohammad Nazrul Islam Talukder and Justice KM Hafizul Alam passed the order, rejecting separate petitions filed by five BNP leaders, including Zia's adviser Amanullah Aman, seeking a stay on their convictions and sentences in graft cases. The Attorney General said, ""If the court allows them to take part in the next general election by staying their conviction, it will go against Article 66 of the Constitution...so the court scrapped their pleas."" Zia was made vice-chairperson of the BNP, the largest political opposition of the country, in March 1983 after the assassination of her husband. She became chairperson of the party on May 10, 1984, a post she is holding till now. In her 35 years of political career, Zia went to the jail several times. During the 2007-2008 tenure of the army-backed caretaker government, she was in jail for about a year on charges of corruption.","Attorney GeneralMahbubeyAlamsaid the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson, who is convicted in two graft cases, cannot contest the upcoming11thgeneral election next month."

Seventy-three-year-old Zia is serving a 10-year jail term in two graft cases. She is unlikely to contest due to her imprisonment and has virtually no time to appeal. A court had handed down a life sentence to BNP acting chairman and Zia's ""fugitive"" son Tarique Rahman two months ago, for masterminding a deadly 2004 grenade attack that killed 24 Awami League leaders and activists.

United Nations investigators have said senior Myanmar military officials should be prosecuted for genocide, but the country has rejected these calls, insisting it was defending itself against militants. Myanmar and Bangladesh signed a deal to bring back the Rohingya but many fear returning without guaranteed rights such as citizenship, access to healthcare and freedom of movement.

The 130-kilometre Friendship Pipeline Project will connect Siliguri in West Bengal in India and Parbatipur in Dinajpur district of Bangladesh. The project will be completed in 30 months and the capacity of the pipeline will be one million metric tonnes per annum. India and Bangladesh had entered into an agreement for the pipeline construction in April this year during Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale's visit to Dhaka. Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister Modi described the cooperation between the two countries as an example for the world, according to an official statement. He said the two countries were neighbours, geographically and family, emotionally. ""Geographically we are neighbours. But emotionally, we are a family. Being part of each other's joys and sorrows, helping each other in development is part of our family. In the past few years, we have shown to the world that when neighbours decide then a lot can be achieved,"" Modi said at the event. Modi said the pipeline will ""add a new chapter in the friendship of the two countries"". He said the proposed pipeline will further energise not just Bangladesh's economy, but also the relationship between the two countries. The Prime Minister said be it decades-old border dispute or development projects, the two countries have made unprecedented progress. He said the project will boost the friendship between India and Bangladesh and the pipeline will help fulfil energy needs at a cheaper rate to Bangladesh's northern part. Through the cross-border pipeline, India will supply fuel oil from its Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL), located at Golaghat in the north-eastern state of Assam, while Bangladesh will receive the oil at Parbatipur Depot of Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) in north-western district of Dinajpur. Modi said although the project was financed by India, after its completion the infrastructure would be handed over to the Bangladesh government.Officials said this pipeline will play an effective role in further strengthening the energy security of Bangladesh. Bangladesh and India signed an MoU on April 9 last to set up the pipeline aimed at pumping Indian oil to Bangladesh with a capacity of 1 million tonnes per year, the report said. India will supply 2.5 lakh tonnes of diesel for the first three years. The import of fuel through the pipeline will be raised further as per the requirements of Bangladesh. The NRL will distribute diesel for 15 years through the pipeline and the time could be expanded following the consent of both sides, local media reported. With the completion of construction of the pipeline, the deal on sale and purchase will be made effective, the report said, quoting BPC sources. The Parbatipur Depot formally received the first consignment of 2,268 tonnes of diesel from the NRL through rail wagons on March 19, 2016. Through the rail wagons, Bangladesh has imported 57,000 tonnes of diesel from India till July 2018 and it is expected that another 50,000 tonnes will be brought from India in August-December 2018 through the same way. Besides the pipeline, the two leaders also inaugurated the construction of the third and fourth dual-gauge rail lines in Dhaka-Tongi section and the dual-gauge rail line in Tongi-Joydebpur section of Bangladesh Railway. Modi said Dhaka-Tongi-Joydebpur Railway project will improve connectivity between the two countries and generate more revenue. He expressed confidence that the proposed railway project will contribute to the process of strengthening national and urban transport in Bangladesh, the statement said. Bangladesh Prime Minister Hasina sought India's continued support and cooperation for Bangladesh's development. She said Bangladesh-India bilateral cooperation has reached to a new height in the past few years while prospects for economic development would substantially be enhanced through such bilateral projects as ""economic development is the biggest challenge for South Asian countries"". ""We've to work collectively for the development and prosperity for the people of both countries in the new areas, including energy, power, road and rail communications,"" she told the conference from her Ganobhaban official residence.

Bangladesh High Commissioner to India Syed Muazzem Ali batted for joint-dredging of rivers and said the prime ministers of the two countries had an extensive discussions on the issue. Responding to a question on China building dams on the Brahmaputra, he said: ""On the Brahmaputra basin, we are very concerned about diversion of water and Bangladesh is prepared to join a joint basin management concept where we will discuss the points of water as it flows from the point of origin to the point of exit in the sea.""

Speaking to reporters at an interaction organised at the Indian Women Press Corps in New Delhi, he added Bangladesh believes in joint river basin management both in the Ganges and the Brahmaputra. The Brahmaputra originates in Tibet. In China, it is known as Yarlung Zangbo. A major river, it enters Bangladesh, where it meets the Ganges and drains into the Bay of Bengal. The envoy also sought to assuage India's concern amid reports of Bangladesh's growing proximity with China. He said Dhaka's relationship with Beijing is primarily in the sphere of economics, trade and commerce. ""China has offered us lines of credit. But that is not free and we have to return it to them. We are also using credit on projects where there is comparative advantage,"" Ali said. He, however, added that Bangladesh has chosen only those lines of credit from China where it has an advantage. ""We have economic relations with China, but with China we don't have the kind of projects we have with India. There are certain areas where the Chinese have an advantage. For example, the longer time to repay (the credit) but not all Chinese credit lines are used. ""We do not want to get into the debt trap. Bangladesh has not faltered on any of its debt with the World Bank, with China, with India or with any country. Individually, I have not forgotten the 1971,"" he added. On the Teesta water-sharing agreement, he said discussions have been going on within India between the states of Sikkim, West Bengal and the Centre.

Soon after the letter was sent, members of the right-wing Hindu Yuva Vahini (HYV) barged into the campus premises shouting slogans against the hanging of Jinnah's portrait.
