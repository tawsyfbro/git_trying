While speaking at the pre-match press conference, Shanto said that Bangladesh working hard to win the series against Sri Lanka. “I think it will be a good series. We are doing everything we can to win this series. I am not feeling pressure about our opponents. We are focused on what we are doing. We want to do what we can control. Every international series has pressure, and that’s also true for our opponents. Everyone is capable of handling this pressure. Like I believe that all of our five or six bowlers can be match-winners,” Shanto was quoted by ESPNcricinfo as saying.The Bangladesh skipper expected that it would be a “very competitive” T20I series against Sri Lanka.“First and foremost, I expect this to be a very competitive series between two good sides,” he said. “What happened in the past, for me, that’s history. It’s gone. I think what we have to do is, certainly from our perspective, is concentrate on what’s in front of us and remember what we’re aiming for. Obviously, we are now in the build-up towards the World Cup. I think all teams now are sort of finalising their sides, their squads give an experience, so ultimately that’s what it is,” he added.He further added that they are preparing for the forthcoming T20 World Cup and the 20-over series against Sri Lanka would help them to do that.“We’re building up to a World Cup, and it’s great that we have such a good competition in front of us to do that, great series to do that in. So, as I said, I’m expecting a very exciting series. There’s some dangerous players on both sides. So I think it’ll be good fun. But as I said, what’s happened in the past is history. It’s about what’s in front of us now,” he added.Shanto will lead a strong Bangladesh squad in the six limited-overs matches at home against Sri Lanka next month. Veteran all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan continues to recover from the retinal issue that was discovered last month and misses out on the squads.The first match of the three-game T20I series between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka will be played on March 4 in Sylhet. The second and third matches of the series will take place on March 6 and 9. The last two matches of the series will also take place at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium in Sylhet.Bangladesh T20I squad: Najmul Hossain Shanto (C), Litton Kumer Das, Anamul Haque Bijoy, Md Naim Sheikh, Tawhid Hridoy, Soumya Sarkar, Shak Mahedi Hasan, Mahmudullah, Taijul Islam, Rishad Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman, Shoriful Islam, Tanzim Hasan Sakib and Aliss Al Islam.

The Congress MP said that the country has more unemployed youths than Bangladesh and Bhutan because Prime Minister Narendra Modi has finished small businesses. “Today, there has been maximum unemployment in the country in the last 40 years. India has double the unemployment as compared to Pakistan. We have more unemployed youth than Bangladesh and Bhutan because Narendra Modi has finished small businesses by demonetization and implementing GST,” Rahul Gandhi said while addressing a gathering in Madhya Pradesh’s Gwalior. The World Bank report points out that in 2022, the youth unemployment rate in India was at 23.22 per cent, which was higher than its neighbours Pakistan (11.3 per cent) and Bangladesh (12.9 per cent). Further, the Congress leader said that in terms of social injustice, the number of backward people in the country is 50 per cent, Tribal at eight per cent, and Dalit at 15 per cent. All these together amount to 73 per cent. “Not a single person among these 73 per cent will be found in big companies. Then Modi Ji says that I am working for the poor,” he said. Rahul Gandhi further said how one can object to caste census without knowing about the population and wealth of Dalits, Tribals and backward classes. “Why would anyone object to this? Narendra Modi ji says that there is no caste in the country. There are only two, poor and rich. If so then how did you become OBC?” he asked. “Narendra Modi ji is afraid because he does not want this 73 per cent to know the truth of the country,” Rahul Gandhi added. Earlier, highlighting the reason behind such high levels of unemployment in the country, Rahul Gandhi on Saturday blamed the Narendra Modi government’s economic policies like demonetization and the Goods and Services Tax, which he claimed, was a huge blow to the MSME sector, which employs the most youths in the country.

Vlaeminck will get the opportunity to restart her international career after returning to the Australian squad for the national women’s team’s first trip to Bangladesh in a decade.However, experienced all-rounder Jess Jonassen’s international career is at a crossroads after being left out of the team that will play three ODIs and three T20Is.The six-game series (three ODIs and three T20Is) is the first time Australia’s women’s team have toured Bangladesh as part of a bilateral series and just the second time they have visited the Asian country following their ICC Women’s T20 World Cup success there in 2014.For the white-ball series, Australia called up a couple of outstanding players who have been fighting injuries to their 15-memebr team for their forthcoming white-ball tour of Bangladesh.With this year’s T20 World Cup set to take place in Bangladesh in September and October, the six-game trip will provide Alyssa Healy’s squad an excellent opportunity to familiarise themselves with the conditions that teams will experience during the 20-over showcase.Spin is expected to play a major role in that tournament, and Australia have recalled left-armer Sophie Molineux to their 15-player squad after she recently returned to the national set-up during a one-off Test against South Africa in Perth, while fast bowler Tayla Vlaeminck has also been included and is set to play her first international match since the start of 2022 due to an injury.The unfortunate players to drop out of the team are left-arm spinner Jonassen and seasoned all-rounder Heather Graham, but selector Shawn Flegler said the two will still have the opportunity to return to the international fold.“We’ve tried to pick a balanced squad with multiple bowling options and, unfortunately for Jess and Heather, they have missed out on this occasion. While we know both will be disappointed to miss out on selection, they’re exceptional cricketers who are highly valued by our group and we certainly haven’t counted them out of future opportunities,” Flegler said in an official statement by cricket.com.au. “With a T20 World Cup in Bangladesh in September, this tour provides a vital opportunity for our players to experience and familiarise themselves with the conditions and wickets we’re likely to face later in the year,” he added. The first of three ODIs will commence in Dhaka on March 21 with the T20I leg of the series to follow the 50-over contests.Australia squad: Alyssa Healy (c), Darcie Brown, Ashleigh Gardner, Kim Garth, Grace Harris (T20s only), Alana King, Phoebe Litchfield, Tahlia McGrath (vc), Sophie Molineux, Beth Mooney, Ellyse Perry, Megan Schutt, Annabel Sutherland, Georgia Wareham and Tayla Vlaeminck.

He also stated that the ICC should intervene to guarantee that restrictions are in place for players who participate in various events within the same window.“We [Bangladesh] don’t have a proper T20 tournament. This sounds very odd. When I am watching the BPL, I sometimes turn off the TV. Some players are not even of the [required] class. I have a big issue with the current system. The ICC need to step in. There has to be some regulations. A player is playing one tournament and then he is playing another tournament. It is like a circus. Players will talk about opportunities, but that’s not right. People will lose interest. I have lost interest,” Hathurusinghe told ESPNcricinfo. Hathurusingha stated that Bangladesh players should be given major responsibilities in the BPL.“We need to have a tournament where our players can do things like batting in the top three… Bangladesh bowlers bowling in the death,” he said. “Where will we learn these things otherwise? We have only one tournament.”This season, Chattogram Challengers, Sylhet Strikers, and Durdanto Dhaka have depended on foreign players in their top three, but Comilla Victorians, Khulna Tigers, and Rangpur Riders have utilised more local players. Hathurusinghe believes the BCB should hold a separate competition for local players before the BPL to give them additional T20 experience. “My suggestion is that we have another tournament before the BPL. The franchises do what they want. Some of the best players are not playing. Then how do you expect the Bangladesh team to be up with the other teams? I am fighting a steep battle,” he said.

https://thenewsmill.com/2024/02/book-review-being-hindu-in-bangladesh-the-untold-story-by-deep-halder-and-avishek-biswas/,Book review: ‘Being Hindu In Bangladesh: The Untold Story’ by Deep Halder and Avishek Biswas,"In ‘Being Hindu in Bangladesh: The Untold Story’, authors Deep Halder and Avishek Biswas set off on a touching exploration of the lives, struggles, and voices of the Hindu minority in Bangladesh. Going beyond the stark statistics, the authors delve into the lived experiences of those who chose to stay in the land that was once East Bengal, exploring the complex crossway of religion, politics, and identity.The book opens with a reflection on the enduring scars of partition, more than seven decades after arbitrary lines divided the subcontinent. After the 1971 genocide and liberation, Bangladesh initially embraced a secular constitution. Over time, however, there was a shift towards Islamization, leading to the formal adoption of an Islamic constitution in 1988. Despite secularism being a foundational principle in theory, Islam has become more influential in the country’s domestic politics since then.The authors set the stage by acknowledging the longing of those who still consider home to be on the other side of the Padma River, emphasizing the mass migration that shaped the region’s demographics. The question lingers: Where are the Hindus who remained in East Bengal, witnessing the transformation into East Pakistan in 1947 and later into Bangladesh in 1971?The authors also carefully draw attention to the dwindling Hindu population in Bangladesh, quoting estimates from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics that reported 17 million Hindus in 2015. This statistic, however, conceals the underlying narrative of threats, attacks, and a pervasive sense of doom that haunts the Hindu community. Halder, drawing on his 20 years of journalistic experience, articulates the prevailing fear in Dhaka that there may not be any Hindus left in Bangladesh within the next three decades.The book offers a nuanced exploration of the role played by Hindus in Bangladeshi politics, culture, and society. It unveils the geographical concentration of Hindus in specific regions, portraying them as a significant electoral force. However, this very concentration becomes a double-edged sword, as the authors reveal allegations of voter intimidation and exclusion during elections. The authors argue that the Hindu minority’s electoral influence makes them a deciding factor in parliamentary elections, where victory margins can be razor thin.Halder and Biswas together give the readers extensive research in Bangladesh, archival material, and firsthand accounts to expose the ground realities behind the statistics. Their aim is not only to bring out the persecution faced by Hindus but also to explore the profound questions about identity and the elusive concept of ‘home.’ The narrative expands beyond borders, reaching into small villages of West Bengal, where the authors engage with administrative officials, locals, and witnesses of historical atrocities.The authors humanize the stories by sharing their own familial connections to the region, acknowledging their shared “refugee blood”. The strength of ‘Being Hindu in Bangladesh’ lies in its emphasis on personal stories, giving a voice to the victims, their families, and eyewitnesses of events spanning 1946, 1971, and 2021. Biswas, an assistant professor of English literature, brings an academic perspective, focusing on archiving oral narratives of Partition history.The consequences of partition have cost numerous lives, both directly and indirectly. The ongoing tension between Hindus and Muslims traces back to this historical trauma. The book contextualizes the East-West partition, highlighting the prolonged nature of the challenges faced by Hindus in the East. And underlines the continuous occurrence of religious and communal violence, drawing parallels between historical events and the contemporary landscape. The book throws light on the cyclical nature of violence and persecution faced by the Hindu minority in Bangladesh.The authors tell us how, throughout human history, religion has been exploited to further political objectives, often at the expense of the vulnerable, minorities, women, elderly people and children. By looking at interreligious dynamics from a historical perspective, we can understand it as a result of political and power struggles, rather than simplifying it solely as a religious issue. It serves as a powerful commentary on the historical manipulation of religion as a political weapon.The book ‘Being Hindu in Bangladesh’ is a gripping exploration of identity, persecution, and the relentless struggle for survival. It not only exposes the harsh realities faced by the Hindu minority but also emphasizes the broader historical patterns of using religion for political gain. The authors, through meticulous research and empathetic storytelling, deliver a narrative that demands attention and reflection in the broader discourse on religious and minority rights.Book: Being Hindu in Bangladesh: The Untold Story by Deep Halder and Avishek Biswas

https://thenewsmill.com/2024/02/india-bangladesh-declared-joint-champions-of-saff-u19-womens-championship/,"India, Bangladesh declared joint champions of SAFF U19 Women’s Championship","India and Bangladesh were declared joint champions of the SAFF U19 Women’s Championship at the BSSSMK Stadium in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on Thursday.India led for the majority of the contest, riding on Sibani Devi Nongmeikapam’s early goal before Sagorika equalised for the hosts in injury time to take it into penalties. After an extraordinary shoot-out which remained locked at 11-11 as every single player on the pitch converted their penalties, the referee performed a coin toss to determine the winners.India won the coin toss, but the decision was later revoked. After more than two hours of waiting, the trophy was shared. This is India’s fourth age-group title in women’s SAFF competition history, and the first on Bangladeshi soil.While Bangladesh edged India in possession in the first half, it was the Young Tigresses who were more incisive going forward. When Sulanjana Raul released Neha into acres of space before goalkeeper Swarna Rani Mandal swept the ball off her feet in the second minute, it was a sign of things to come.Understandably, the final generated considerable interest in the local football circle. With the prospect of Bangladesh winning a back-to-back title looming large, a big crowd thronged the stadium long before the final started.They came with drums and bugles, flags and banners. The festive mood of the partisan crowd, however, received a stunning blow when India took the lead off another well-constructed move as captain Nitu Linda showed exemplary vision to release Sibani behind the Bangladesh defence. The pacy winger was clever enough to dodge it the first time over the onrushing Swarna. Sibani could have added another just minutes later, as her half-volley sailed inches above the crossbar.India, however, failed to defend the lead and conceded the equaliser well into the add-on time of the second half. Linda’s headed clearance fell onto the path of Sagorika, who slotted it past Anika, a carbon copy of her goal against India in the group stage at exactly the same minute – 93rd.Back to the rest of the match, Raul was efficient in her role as a false nine, feeding Neha and Sibani on the overlaps time and again. Her sharp turns and quick feet often left the hosts falling flat.India defended compactly, leaving Bangladesh with no option but to try their luck from a distance. Sapna Rani first sent a 25-yard shot high and wide before hitting her second effort on target, which Anika Devi Sharubam collected with ease for her first save of the match.For large parts of the second half, India looked likelier to get a second goal than Bangladesh an equaliser. In the 54th minute, the Young Tigresses had a glorious chance as Sibani picked out Neha with a diagonal ball into the box. Neha tried to lay it for Pooja, but Swarna swiftly gathered it before she could get to the end of it.Neha remained in the thick of things for the remainder of the match. A few minutes later, her cross from the left was headed wide by Raul. Corners have been Bangladesh’s strong point throughout the tournament and they did threaten from those. First, Surma Jannat headed over Sapna’s delivery before the latter struck the crossbar directly from her inswinging corner.At the other end, Neha also hit the bar in the 88th minute with a stinging left-footed strike from the edge of the box. That was India’s final chance of sealing the deal in regulation time because Bangladesh restored parity five minutes later.Each one of India’s starting eleven players successfully converted their penalties in the shoot-out, including goalkeeper Anika, who scored the 11th and the final one. Bangladesh were equally clinical, but Anika would’ve felt luck was not on her side as she jumped the right way for six of the 11 shots but couldn’t make a save.The AIFF Acting Secretary General, M Satyanarayan said: “India, despite being declared winners after the spin of the coin, decided to accept the officials’ request for sharing the trophy as the situation was simmering and a section of the home fans was found indulging in creating disturbances. Since the security of the players and other team officials is our utmost priority, the AIFF decided to agree to the request of the organisers.”India U19: Anika Devi Sharubam (GK), Sonibia Devi Irom, Thoibisana Chanu Toijam, Viksit Bara, Pooja, Lalita Boypai, Sulanjana Raul, Nitu Linda (C), Neha, Sibani Devi Nongmeikapam, Heena Khatun.(ANI)",None,None,None,None,TNM NewsDesk,bangladesh,2024-02-09 13:02:00,2024-02-09 13:32:00
https://thenewsmill.com/2024/02/india-ready-for-redemption-in-saff-u19-womens-final-against-bangladesh/,India ready for redemption in SAFF U19 Women’s final against Bangladesh,"The India U19 Women’s National Team will be out to break a voodoo on the artificial turf of BSSSMK Stadium on Thursday when they meet hosts Bangladesh in the SAFF U19 Women’s Championship 2024 final.Despite marked improvement in women’s football, India somehow hold a dismal record in this age group in SAFF. The title has eluded India on more than one occasion, the latest example being the SAFF U20 Women’s Championship in Dhaka last year, when Bangladesh pipped India to win the trophy.Thursday’s final will definitely be a huge opportunity for India to put past records on the burner and retain the title. The Young Tigresses will certainly enter the final match with a strong determination to seize the championship title and set the records straight from the Indian perspective.In the group stage, India won comfortably against Bhutan (10-0) and Nepal (4-0) but lost against Bangladesh by a solitary goal to enter the final as the second-place finishers in the group. Apart from having a tight defence and a balanced midfield, India enjoy good attacking qualities with forwards Pooja and Sulanjana Raul and wingers Neha and Sibani Devi putting up a commendable show.Well, despite all the positive signs, it will definitely not be easy to topple the hosts, who beat India in the group league earlier this week. No one knows it better than India’s head coach, Sukla Dutta.“I’m truly not pleased that India have been losing to Bangladesh for the past three years, but tomorrow will be the time to change that. I am sure both teams will put in equal efforts, but the team who score first will likely emerge champion, as the confidence to score more will start from there,” she said ahead of the Bangladesh clash.“I understand there will be huge support for Bangladesh, but we’ll only concentrate on our own game,” she added, according to a release.Having already played against Bangladesh in the group stage, head coach Sukla knows how to handle the situation. “We’ve played one match against the hosts in this tournament, so we know exactly how they play. But there’s no doubt they’re a good side. I have instructed my players to stay focused on their positions and prioritise man-marking. It’s crucial to cover the midfield more effectively because if we disrupt their ball distribution in that area, we can perform even better.“I hope my girls deliver the same strong performance they displayed in their last game against Bangladesh two days ago,” she said.In the team meeting today, captain Nitu Linda shared her thoughts on the final with all the players and the coaching staff and said, “We’re up against Bangladesh once again. It offers us the chance to rectify our mistakes from the previous match. I am confident in clinching the trophy. Everyone else here should be thinking in the same manner.”Nitu told her teammates: “We won’t allow them to exploit our weaknesses. Instead, we will focus on correcting our errors, especially our communication on the pitch and we should stick to our game plan. Tomorrow’s match is extremely crucial for us.“In the final, our aim should be to control the midfield, minimise mistakes, and execute through passes effectively. If I can deliver on these aspects and contribute with goals, I believe we can win.”The match will kick off at 5:30 pm IST.",None,None,None,None,TNM NewsDesk,bangladesh,2024-02-08 16:00:00,2024-02-08 16:30:00
